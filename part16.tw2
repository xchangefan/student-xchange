  <img src="Part16/Class18.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="550" align="left">
  Today your Women's Studies professor lets the class know that the district attorney has finally been able to secure the release of
  the women trapped in the engineering department's chastity belts.  "Well, all but one of them," she clarifies. "The DA had long since
  made plea deals with most of those responsible in the engineering department.  But he had refused to offer any plea deal with the head
  of the department unless he turned over the encryption keys needed to unlock the poor women he'd trapped."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "The evil bastard had been willing to deal for weeks now, except for one belt.  He'd stubbornly refused to unlock one of his victims,
  the brave woman who first came forward to me. For a long time the DA held out, hoping the threat of an extended jail sentence would
  convince him to release her too.  But he finally came to the conclusion that it wasn't fair to the other women to wait any longer."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "The DA is confident that a few months in prison and the hope of parole will be enough to convince him to release his last victim.
  Until then, let's all keep her in our thoughts."

  "First, let me apologize if the woman pictured here is one of you.  Unfortunately, the media continues to use salacious photos of his victims

  face the consequences for his crimes. Of course, as there always are in cases like this, conspiracy theories are already popping up
  with alternative explanations for his death.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  I doubt one of the victim's fathers is a prison guard, and that he killed him. That seems unlikely. The other theory that seems
  to be gaining traction seems more plausible to me. I can certainly believe that there are wealthy, well-connected people that were
  involved in these crimes but not yet identified. And I can also believe that they'd be willing to arrange for his death to keep
  their involvement from coming out. But that is likely just my bias showing. The simplest explanation is likely the truth: he
  took his own life because he couldn't face what he'd done or the consequences of it."

  "Hopefully they were able to secure the release of the woman that he was still keeping trapped in one of those belts.  And if not

  still had them somewhere or if he had long since deleted the unlock code for his last victim."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "That means she has very little chance of being unlocked from the belt, at least anytime soon.  Maybe they'll be able to figure

  that will help her cope with her situation.  As she is one of my students, I let her know that I will whatever accommodations she might
  need given her situation. I told the university that they should instruct her other professors to do so as well.  Given the university's

<<nobr>>
  You try to stop thinking about that, but your mind keeps keeps going back to the need you are feeling between your own legs at the moment.  You
  do think about what it must be like for her.  Unlike yours, you know her need can never be satisfied, but that just makes your own need grow.
  And she'll never be able to forget about it either.  At least ten times a day, she'll be on her knees with a cock in her mouth, with her belt

  "But instead they talked me into wearing one too," she says crying more now.  "The engineering guy, the one that
  has been in the news, talked about how they could set my belt to be just like yours and it'd bring us closer together.
  Maybe it's just how submissive I am, but it sounded so hot that I said yes."

  Whenever you can, you and Bailey try to get your "Daily Ten" in together.  Part of it is that it makes it easier
  that way. You don't know if it's because your belts are 'linked' in some way, or if it would have worked this way
  for the other girls too.  But you've figured out if both take turns on the guy's cock, and both swallow enough of his
  cum, then both of your belts will give you credit for it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But that's only part of it.  The other part is that the pleasure you both get while sucking a cock, sometimes bringing
  you close to an orgasm, is something you enjoy more when you and Bailey can experience it together.  And as long as you
  both are sucking his cock, the guys don't seem to mind that you and her are much more into each other than you are him.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Of course sometimes schedules don't work out, so you both also take care of cocks on your own when you need to as well.

  Eventually you and Bailey grow accustomed to your situation.  The need you both always feel never goes away, but

  Bailey is having a harder time keeping up with her studies given her situation.  She can't ever focus on her work, and

  "Many of the toys and tests involved various forms of restraint. As they explained to me, this is to limit the number of variables being tested
  by preventing the subjects from moving or adding to the pleasure they were being given.  But all the testers I saw were consenting, and most seemed

  <h1>Women's studies class</h1>
  Your professor recounts her story trying out the test equipment with the head of the engineering department, "As expected,
  the initial portion of the demonstration was rather frustrating as I was brought to the edge of an orgasm, but then not given
  one..."  You notice your professor's eyes taking a far away look.  "Actually, I'm not sure how many times.  I just remember
  hearing a soothing voice through the earpieces I was wearing."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <video src="Part16/Class3.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="400"></video>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Actually, my recollection of the rest of my test session is a bit fuzzy now.  I mainly just recall how enjoyable it was.  I do remember that I
  orgasmed many times later during it.  And after it was over, I didn't have any more concerns with what the engineering department was doing."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You wonder how longer her session lasted, and how many times she was denied, and what the "soothing voice" was saying to her.
  <<if $JobEngineer or $JobEngineerOld or $JobTestSubject or $JobTestSubjectOld>>
    You know first hand how suggestible someone can get when they are repeatedly denied.
  <<else>>
    You can only imagine how suggestible you'd get if you were repeatedly denied like that.
  <</if>>
  You'd probably be willing to do whatever was asked of you to be allowed an orgasm at that point, or even believe whatever
  the voice in your ear was telling you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But, she's certainly not like that.  She's much more strong willed than you'd be.  And her session was just so she could feel what
  it was like so she'd know it was safe. You're just being silly imagining they brainwashed her or something, probably because of all
  those insane theories you and your classmates were throwing around earlier.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "After my session was over I spoke with the department head again.  He accepted my apology about jumping to conclusions.
  He also acknowledged that having another perspective working with them would help ensure there weren't any future concerns.
  And it would be good to have another point of view as well."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "So, I will be working with them in the future to ensure their test subjects are treated ethically, and offering an additional
  woman's perspective when I can.  I'll let you all know more as things [[move forward|Part16Finals]]."
<</nobr>>

::Part16WomensStudiesReport4
<<nobr>>
  <h1>Women's Studies class</h1>
  "As I previous mentioned, I've been working with the engineering department, helping to provide another perspective to their work.
  As part of that, I've helped them with a product they've been working on that will hopefully help address the epidemic of sexual
  assaults that have been occurring near or on campus. I know some of you have been helping them test the product already."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "The product is a computerized chastity belt." She pauses for a second before continuing. "Now, I can see the look on some of your
  faces, and that was my initial reaction as well. It shouldn't be the woman's responsibility to wear something to prevent rape.  If
  anything, men should be required to wear a chastity cage over their cocks.  Some schools have proposed exactly this.  And it would
  help with rape and assault from your fellow students.  However, the majority of the attacks are occurring off campus, and it's
  believed the rapist or rapists are not even students.  So caging just the men on campus would do little to help here."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "But don't think this is some medieval device a woman is forced to wear. The woman wearing it can take it off whenever she wants.
  Well, unless she turns that control over to someone else, but doing that is her choice too.  And it can't be forced off of her.  It
  can only be removed with her consent, and if someone attempts to forcibly remove it, or if the wearer hits a panic button on the
  phone app that interfaces with the belt, or if she says a 'distress phrase' that is configured, campus security will be alerted and
  dispatched to her 
  <<if $RapistBeltAlarm>>
    position. One rape near campus has already been prevented by one of the testers using this feature," she says not knowing that
    it was you involved in that incident. "The capture of that rapist reduced the number of attacks, but sadly not to zero."

    position."

  "Now there are a number of possible designs they've been trying out.  They'll continue to offer a variety of options for women
  with different needs, but I gave several of them a try so I could offer my opinion on which should be their default recommendation.
  I rejected some options that were rather bulky, others included leg chains that limited range of motion, and some make bowel
  movements significantly more of a chore."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "The most practical one offered a slim profile that wouldn't interfere with most clothing options, or range of
  motion, and did not make going to the bathroom more difficult.  The anal opening, along with temporary removal of the front shield
  to deal with menstruation when needed allows the woman wearing to to wear it continuously as long as she likes, removing it only
  when she chooses to have sex."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "And best of all, it's quite comfortable.  In fact, I'm [[wearing mine right now|Part16WomensStudiesReport5]]."

  <h1>Showing the class her belt</h1>
  <img src="Part16/Class8.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450" align="left">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  Your professor pulls her shorts to the side to show the slim, but secure-looking chastity belt she is wearing. "As you can see
  it's barely noticeable under my clothing, even if you are looking for it.  But it is quite secure, unless it's unlocked.  Though,
  unless you are wanting to engage in vaginal sex, its rarely necessary to ever remove it."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Masturbation, for example, is quite easy while still wearing it.  You can have it bring you to orgasm quickly if you want, or slowly
  build you to one if that's what you want.  I've been told you can even program it to repeatedly bring you to the edge of an orgasm,
  but deny you again and again, and then eventually allow an orgasm, or deny you a final time.  I was told this can be quite a thrill
  for the wearer, but they have to engage the timed lockout function as few would be able to resist changing the settings after a
  few edges."  You see her get that far away look she did when she first talked about meeting with the engineering department.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Lesbian couples can program their belts to bring them to orgasm simultaneously.  And women that are part of a heterosexual couples
  can program her belt to do the same with her partner.  Though, obviously she'd need to do the work of bringing her partner to
  orgasm herself in that case. And some women enjoy the thrill of giving the control of her belt over to her partner, which
  is available as an option as well."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="Part16/Class7.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="600" align="right">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  "I'm confident the new belts will be very popular as we start to offer them to all women on campus," your professor tells the
  class.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "All women?" one of the students asks with concern in their voice.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "If you are worried about some women being left out. Don't worry. That was going to be an issue with their original plans, but I've made sure that
  the department has options available for everyone who identifies as female, regardless of the specifics of her body.  Though, obviously the device's
  functionality might be slightly different in some cases.  But I've worked with them to make sure the functionality matches as much as possible."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "For example, the cock-cage-style devices also can detect anal activity.  The wearer can program hers to administer vibrations to enhance her
  experience, or event to administer shocks to prevent orgasm from prostate stimulation if she wishes.  For those who want to protect themselves
  from anal penetration entirely, belt-style devices are also available with a rear bar that prevents anal access while still allowing for bodily
  functions with only a moderate additional amount of cleanup needed."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The student clarifies their question and the professor responds again, "No, of course no one will be required to wear one.  But I
  can't imagine why a woman wouldn't want to wear one given the opportunity."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "They'll be offering it to all women on campus soon, but I was able to get all of you the privilege of being the first to be a
  part of the [[official roll-out|Part16WomensStudiesReport6]] of the new program.

  <h1>Campus Safety Program</h1>
  <img src="Part16/Class9.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="650" align="left">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  Your professor has started making belt-fitting appointments for all of the women in your class.  She hasn't asked any of them if they
  actually want one of the Engineering department's new belts or to be the first to join the new campus safety program.  She just seems
  to assume that everyone is as eager about the program as she is.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You still find it odd that she'd be as keen on this program as she is.  From your impressions of her earlier in the year you would
  have thought she'd be against this program because it implies women have to wear something to protect themselves instead of holding
  men responsible for their actions.  And you'd have thought she'd be deeply skeptical of the very idea of a chastity belt.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But instead, she's the biggest supporter of the program, and helps reassure everyone else that might have been skeptical as well.
  So far all of your classmates that have had their appointments have came back wearing a belt.  A number of them have came back
  eager to show them off, and eager to rave about the pleasure and orgasm functions of the belt.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Now it's time for your appointment.
  <<if $JobBetaTester>>
    Of course, you are already wearing one of the belts.  So your appointment is just to
    [[switch your belt out of beta mode|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Already]].
  <<elseif $RapistFightBack or $RapistBeltAlarm or $RapistRun or $KidnapEscape>>
    Given your own experiences, you are eager for the protection the belt offers.  You'd thought about asking your professor
    if you could be one of the first to get her belt.  But then you would have probably had to talk about your
    <<if $KidnapEscape>>
      kidnapping,
    <<else>>
      attack,
    <</if>>
    and you'd rather not.  So you just wait until [[it's your turn to get fitted|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]].
  <<elseif $JobEngineer and $JobEngineerLockFormer>>
    You've already had to wear one of those diabolical belts and are dreading the thought of wearing one again.  But you tell
    yourself it won't be as bad this time around.  Before your boss had turned off the orgasm functions of the belt so you could
    test trying to hack it.  But now your belt will be fully featured, and hopefully much more fun.  Besides, it's not like
    you have a choice other than [[to wear the belt|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]].  Not if you want to keep your job at least.
  <<elseif $JobEngineer>>
    You've seen what wearing those belts can do to a girl.  Part of you wants to refuse to wear it so you don't turn into a sex-starved
    slut like some of the girls wearing them have.  But then again part of you fantasizes about exactly that.  But you tell yourself that
    you'll be one of the ones that can keep things under control.  Besides, it's not like
    you have a choice other than [[to wear the belt|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]].  Not if you want to keep your job at least.
  <<elseif $JobAthlete>>
    The athletic department is requiring all of the athletes to [[wear them|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]].  Well, all the female
    athletes that is.  Of course, most of you will need to have them off when you actually compete.  You'll also need to take them off
    whenever you want to visit the massage room.  Well, maybe not, if the orgasm functions are as good as people keep saying they are.
    Though, there's something to be said for the personal touch too.
  <<elseif $JobCheerleader>>
    The athletic department is requiring all of the cheerleaders to [[wear them|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]].  They are even
    requiring the male cheerleaders to wear one of those cock cage ones, not just the cheerleaders that identify as female.
    Of course, those of you with belts will need to take them off when you perform though.  They said the cock cages can stay on though.
  <<elseif $JobCheerleaderFundraiser>>
    The athletic department is requiring all of the cheerleaders to [[wear them|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]].  Even ones like
    you who do much of the work off the field.  Though, of course, you'll need to take it off whenever you are along with a university
    donor.
  <<elseif $JobFitnessMassage>>
    The athletic department is requiring all of the women working in the fitness center to [[wear them|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]].
    Though, of course, you'll need to take it off whenever you are with an athlete that wants more than a hand or blow job.
  <<elseif $JobLibrary>>
    <<set setup.addSex({sex: 'male', name:"Library Boss"})>>
    When your boss tells you that you'll be required to wear one if you want to keep your job, you think you are being singled out at 
    first because of the earlier issues you've had with her.  But she assures you that all female university employees are being
    required to [[wear them|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]] to demonstrate the university's commitment to safety.  She shows you
    that she's already wearing hers.
    <br><br>
    If she's willing to wear one, and most of the other women on campus will be wearing them too, you feel like you don't have any
    reason to say now.  Besides, you don't want to lose your job.
  <<elseif setup.areDating('Aaron')>>
    Daddy wants you to wear one of the belts so he knows that you are safe, so you
    [[eagerly head to your appointment|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]].
  <<elseif $PlayerSideEffectSubmissive > 3>>
    The thought of being in a belt like that turns you on.  You fantasize about giving control of when you can unlock it, and when you
    can cum, to someone else.  You aren't sure if you'll ever actually do that, but you can't resist the idea of wearing the belt.
    So you [[eagerly head to your appointment|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]].
  <<elseif $JobModel or $JobBikiniBarista or $JobCallGirl>>
    You wonder if you should be the first to [[turn down the belt|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Refuse]], since you'll just need to take it
    off every time you are at work anyway.  But you would be safer when you aren't at work
    [[if you wore one|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]], and as the other girls showed everyone, it's just a few buttons on the app to take it off after all.
  <<else>>
    If you [[turn down the belt|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Refuse]], you'd be the first so far, but they do say it's your choice.  But
    everyone else has [[decided to wear one|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]], so maybe you should too.

  ask questions as he has to hurry on to the fitting scheduled right after your visit.

    so you stop by the coffee shop near campus to see about getting a job as a barista.  After a quick interview, you are hired.
    Hopefully it won't take you long to pick up everything you need to learn. But
  <</if>>
  you still have one last bit of feedback for them.  You are sending a suggestion for some sort of indicator to show what "mode"
  you belt is in would be great.  Obviously it wouldn't be in this release, but maybe something they could add in a future hardware
  update.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You suggest red for "chaste", yellow for "monogamous", and green for "normal".
  <<if $ComputerChastityMode == "lesbian">>
    And maybe pink for belts like yours in "lesbian" mode.  With something like that you'd maybe get fewer guys hitting on you,
    thinking they have a chance. And probably many more girls, which would be
    <<if setup.haveGirlfriend()>>
      fun, even if it might annoy $dating[0].
    <<else>>
      really fun.
    <</if>>
  <<elseif $ComputerChastityMode == "open-relationship">>
    And probably green for yours too, since it's just as open to having fun as the "normal" ones are.  A green light would let guys
    know that your boyfriend still allows you to enjoy yourself.  Well, certainly for other guys to enjoy you at least.
  <<elseif $ComputerChastityMode == "chaste">>
    A red light would let guys know that you aren't available for sex.  That would keep most guys away.  Though hopefully it wouldn't
    keep away the right guy, one that would be willing to wait.
  <<elseif $ComputerChastityMode == "monogamous">>
    A yellow light would let guys know that you are spoke for, and that they don't have a chance.  Hopefully that would mean
    fewer of them hitting on you.
  <<else>>
    <<set $ComputerChasteMode to "normal">>
    A green light would let guys know that even though you are wearing a belt, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself.  And it
    certainly doesn't mean that they can't enjoy themselves with you.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you are back home you look over the app to see what might be different now that it is out of beta mode.
  You see that the "Unlock" button is still disabled for you.
  <<if $ComputerChastityMode == "open-relationship">>
    But it seems that anyone other than you can unlock your belt it since you are in "open-relationship" mode. They just need to install
    the app if they don't have it already. You expect most students will have it installed soon, if they don't already.
  <<elseif $ComputerChastityOwner == "Your father">>
    Your father has full "Owner" permissions now, and can unlock you whenever he wants. You doubt there's much chance of that happening.
  <<elseif $ComputerChastityOwner == "self" and $ComputerChastityMode != "chaste" and $ComputerChasteMode != "lesbian" >>
    It says that while your belt is "self-owned" there is an initial "breaking-in" period for the belt that is preventing unlocking at the moment.
    <<if $dating.length>>
      It says that if you transfer control to $dating[0], the break-in period doesn't apply though.
      <br><br>
      You quickly do that without even really thinking it through. After a single confirmation box box it changes to a "Pending" status.
      Then a few minutes later, after $dating[0] has accepted the ownership from their phone, it shows that now $dating[0] is now your "Owner".
      You make a note to talk to them about rewording that, as your <b>belt's</b> owner.
      <<set $ComputerChastityOwner to $dating[0]>>
    <<else>>
      It says if you assign an owner, the break-in period does not apply though. You start thinking who you can trust enough to assign control to,
      or maybe it'd be better to just wait out the break-in period.

      When looking at the owner options, you let it know you aren't in a relationship. It looks like when you are you can add that person as
      an owner and they can unlock your belt. Though it looks like there's a waiting period between. You guess that's to prevent people from adding
      every one night stand they meet. Your belt is still in "monogamous" mode after all.
    <</if>>
  <<elseif $ComputerChastityMode == "chaste">>
    And it'll probably stay that way until you get married. Though you also have the option to switch it to "monogamous" mode. You can do some
    stuff right away with your boyfriend then... you imagine what is cum will taste like the first time... But you have to wait six months before
    he'll be able to unlock you if you aren't married. It seemed reasonable when they explained it, you wouldn't want to just meet a guy and give
    your belt over to him in a moment of horniness, would you?
  <<elseif $dating.length>>
    It says that you need to setup an owner first.

  In the next room a different technician starts explaining the features of your belt and the app that goes with it.  Among the

  <<if $ComputerChastityOwner == "Your father">>
    <<set $ComputerChastityMode to "monogamous">>
    'monogamous' mode.  That means you can only engage in sex with $dating[0] while wearing the belt.  As you are both belted,
    the options for either of you will be limited unless your owner unlocks one or both of you."
    <br><br>
    You interrupt, "But we are supposed to each other's 'owner'.  So I guess we can do that whenever we want?"
    <br><br>
    He checks his tablet and then says the name of the person listed as both your owner and $dating[0]'s, and it's your father,
    not each other!  "But, that's my father.  Who made him my own... my belt's owner?" you ask angrily.
    <br><br>
    He looks around several screens on his tablet and answers.  "Well, it looks like your original appointment was canceled.  Then your
    professor contacted us to reschedule it for you, and your father was added as owner at that time.  And it was noted from the beginning
    that $dating[0] wanted her belt to have the same setting as yours, so that change was made on hers as well."
    <br><br>
    $dating[0]'s appointment was a few hours ago.  You guess she just didn't ask any questions or pay attention enough to realize the change
    that was made.  He continues, "Is that not what you intended? If it isn't then you should probably contact him, we aren't allowed to
    change the owner of a belt without the current owner's permission."
    <br><br>
    "I hope that cleared up the confusion for you," he says. "Now let me go over the mutual tease and orgasm setting and messaging options
    with you."
    <br><br>
    You are upset at the change being made, but perk up when you hear that the belts will sometimes gently tease both you and $dating[0]
    when you are together. And with skin-to-skin contact, the intensity will increase, sometimes giving one or both of you an orgasm.
    When you ask what 'sometimes' means he tells you that the probability can be configured by the owner, but is currently set high.
    You make a note to make sure you don't upset your dad and risk him lowering that or turning it off entirely.
  <<else>>
    <<set $ComputerChastityMode to "lesbian">>

    and both of you are setup as joint owners of both belts.  The belts can only be unlocked or owner-controlled settings changed, if
    you both approve."
    <br><br>
    "Now let me go over the mutual tease and orgasm setting and self-lockout options with you.  Those can be activated by either of you,
    but neither of you can cancel them before the lockout period is over..."

    give you the encouragement vibrations it is supposed to give you.  And you are doubtful it would let you cum when he does, if you
    managed to get him tribble out a bit of cum while caged.
    <br><br>
    So you eagerly unlock Peter so that you can suck his cock properly. As soon as you feel the sensations the belt begins to give

    You wish $dating[0] was set up as your 'owner'.  Then you could ask him to have belt give you an orgasm when you need one. Or at

    father as the owner, there's no chance of that. You are ashamed enough that he knows ever time you drop to your knees for $dating[0].

    You sometimes try to talk $dating[0] into making your belt give you an orgasm.  You know he can do it with a touch of a button.  Or

    supposed to be the best.
    <<if $WomensStudiesBeltAssistant>>
      You know they told him that during his owner training, and it's probably true.

    Though thankfully, he's still eager to fuck you frequently as well.  At first you are always bound when he does.  You know it's
    because the training they game told him that it's easier that way, to avoid any complaints when it's time to put your belt back on.
    After a while though, it becomes clear that it isn't necessary.  You always willingly, if sometimes reluctantly, put your belt back
    on when he tells you.
    <<if !$PlayerEasytoOrgasm>>

        you feel feel him go deep and his cock twitch inside you.  Your belt gives you an extra second or two of pleasure a few moments
        later, when he lets you swallow the cum from the condom he filled.  But it's never enough to push you over, no matter how close
        to an orgasm you were when he was inside you.
      <<elseif $PlayerProtectionWithdraw>>
        he pulls out and comes on your back or stomach.  Though if he has enough time, he'll switch to your mouth and finish there.  That's
        what you prefer. You know that will give you a few extra seconds of pleasure, and maybe an orgasm when you swallow it down.
      <<else>>
        you feel feel him go deep and his cock twitch inside you.  Your clit throbs for just a bit more stimulation, but all you feel is
        his cum slowly draining out of you.

      <br><br>
      If you don't get off, you always ache for him to reach down between your legs and play with your clit, just for a little bit, so you
      can finish too. But you know they've told him it's better if you cum with him inside you, or not at all.  That doesn't make it
      any less maddening.  But it does make you yearn to feel him inside you again, which is probably the point.

  "There were a few different transitional options for chaste mode.  The one you selected was that the setting is locked in until

  point we'll change your belt to limited-monogamous mode.  This will allow you to engage in oral and anal with your partner, but
  unlocking will still be prohibited.  Once a wedding date is set, please let us know and we can coordinate on enabling full-unlock
  access then."

  "While unlocking is not allowed, or changing the chaste settings, there are a number of options that available to you.  Of particular

  You are terrified now about how long he's going to expect you to go without one.  "But they also explained that the occasional one
  can be very effective as a motivator.  They linked up your belt's account with your school system there.  I have it set to let you
  have one every few weeks, as long as you attend class every day, and keep your grades up."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Oh, and I don't want to prevent you from meeting a guy, hopefully a future husband, while you are there.  But I know how college

  "What is this I hear about you not wanting to participate in the university's safety program?" he questions you.  You start to object
  and to ask why they would even contact <b><i>him</i></b> about this.  But he keeps at you with more questions.
  <<if $CampusMinistry and $dating.length>>
    "Are you worried you won't be able to keep $dating[0] happy? Don't worry about that.
    <<if setup.haveGirlfriend()>>
      They tell me they have settings just for girls like you two, so you can have fun without even taking the belts off.

      Obviously there's plenty you can do to make your man happy without even taking the belt off.
    <</if>>
    And, it's not like you or $dating[0] won't be able to unlock it anyway.  I think you just don't like the idea of, and you still dream

  <<elseif $CampusMinistry>>
    "Are you worried you won't be able to find a man when you are wearing a belt like that.  Don't worry, he'll appreciate that you've

  <<else>>
    "Are you worried you won't be able to keep whoring it up around campus anymore?"
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "No, of course not," you tell your father.  "It's just that..." he cuts you off before you can offer up any excuses as to why you
  shouldn't have to wear a belt.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He continues to go through all the benefits the belt has, and not listening to any of the worries you have about it.  He's
  clearly not calling to discuss the pros and cons of the belt with you, but to instruct you as to why he expects you to
  [[change your mind and wear the belt|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Accept]].
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $FatherSettings>>
    You've grown accustomed to doing what your father wants, so you eventually agree to do as he says, to make him happy and because

  <<else>>
    You know it won't end well with your father if you [[continue to refuse|Part16WomensStudiesReport6RefuseDisown]] to wear the belt,
    but the more he argues the more you wonder if maybe that's what you need to do if you are ever going to be your own woman.

  Later you pull out your phone, trying to call Dylan or Cassie to talk about what happened with your father.  But your phone says
  "Emergency Calls Only".  When you try to use it you get a message saying that your line has been suspended.  "Fuck, already?", you say
  out loud when you realize your father has already turned off your phone line from his family plan.

<<nobr>>
  You guess you'll need to look for someplace to get a new number for your phone too.  But at least you

  <h1>Alternate Assignment</h1>
  Your professor is disappointed when you decide not to wear one of the chastity belts, but she sees that she doesn't have any hope of
  convincing you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are worried she might give you a bad grade in her class for not participating in her pet project though.  So you ask if there's some
  other way that you can help out with her 'Safety' program.  She tells you she has the perfect idea.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  With all the new women that will be participating in the safety program and being fitted for belts, the Engineering department is
  needing help with all the fittings.  They give you a few hours of training, and then assign you to help fit the girls volunteering
  for the belts.
<</nobr>>

  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    It's embarrassing for you at first, seeing all the other women naked.  The transwomen needing cock cages are especially embarrassing
    for you when they are too hard for you to put their cage on them.  Then you have to use the ice pack.  You are wearing gloves
    when you touch their hard cocks, but it still makes you feel strange.  Though, you always feel better about it once their cages
    are secured.
  <<else>>
    It's fun seeing all the other women naked.  You especially have fun with the transwomen needing cock cages when they are too hard
    for you to put their cage on them.  You usually subtly give their cock a few soft strokes with your gloved hand before you
    apply the ice pack.  Once their cages are secured, you give it a little tug.  It's not part of the fitting requirements, but
    you like seeing their cock try to get hard as it wishes for another stroke.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It's also part of your assignment to do a brief [[follow-up check|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Refuse2]] after they've been in
  their 'safety' devices for a few days.
<</nobr>>

::Part16WomensStudiesReport6Refuse2
<<nobr>>
  <h1>Follow-up checks</h1>
  You talk with many of the newly belted after they've been their chastity devices for a week or so.  You are supposed to be making
  sure the devices fit ok, that there's not any chafing or other issues, and to assist with any technical issues they might have.
  Though, for anything but basic questions about using the phone app synced to their belt, you have refer them to one of the engineers.
  But they also tend to share their personal experiences with the belts so far too.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You aren't surprised by the reports from the girls using the orgasm-inducing features of the belt.  As you'd expect, they all rave
  about how great the orgasms the belt gives them are.  They especially like the orgasms that the belt takes its time with, building
  up slowly over an hour or more.  They say it's a good thing the setting locks in though once they select it, because they'd never
  be able to resist making it hurry up, and according to them it's always worth the wait in the end.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <video src="Part15/Buddy54.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="450"></video>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="Part16/Class15.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400" align="left">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  But what you hadn't expected is the girls that selected the self-lockout options.  The belt lets them lock themselves out of
  changing any of the settings for a period of time, and if they don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend or someone else that they've
  given control over to, then they are stuck with whatever settings they chose until the time is up.  (Technically the Engineering
  department could unlock them too, but they only do that in emergencies, so you don't mention it to them.)
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The ones that seem the most desperate are the ones that activated the belt's tease and denial settings before locking themselves
  out. They end up getting brought to the edge of an orgasm however many times a day, only to be denied at the last minute every time.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "The popup notification suggesting it came up when I was already horny, and I wasn't thinking very clearly," they always say. "I
  thought it would be fun, and I guess it has been. But I didn't realize how frustrating it would be or I wouldn't have went with how
  long a lockout as it suggested.  Please, I'll do anything for just one orgasm!"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    You've heard rumors that often the male engineers take advantage of their vulnerable state before telling them what can be done
    for them.
  <<else>>
    You know the male engineers usually have them drop to their knees, if they aren't already on them, and suck their cock at this
    point.  Only afterwards do they tell them what can be done for them. You would judge the guys for taking advantage of them, but
    you've heard from the locked girls just how much they love sucking cock when they are in this state, so you suppose it's a win-win
    for both of them.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When they speak with you though, you just give them the offer you are supposed to give them, without requiring anything from
  them first.  "I'm allowed to switch your belt over to 'virtual keyholder' mode.  It'll give you an orgasm today, but it'll also
  add an addition 5% to 50% of your original lockout onto your lockout period.  It'll also remove you ability to see how much time
  you have left before the lockout ends.  The daily teasings will also be more variable when they happen."  They've been agreeing
  ever since you mentioned the orgasm, but you have to finish.  "And finally, you may get additional offers for other orgasms,
  with either actions required from you, or further time extensions required.  Those are all optional though."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Yes! Yes! Please!" They always say.
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    Even if it's a bit embarrassing, you
  <<else>>
    You 
  <</if>>
  love watching them orgasm for the first time in a while, right there in front of you.  Though, you wonder how they'll feel a few
  hours later when the joy of their pleasure has faded and the realization sets in that they'll be in this state even longer than they'd
  planned.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Though as interesting as the reports from the single women are, hearing from the
  [[ones with partners|Part16WomensStudiesReport6Refuse3]] is usually even more exciting.
<</nobr>>

::Part16WomensStudiesReport6Refuse3
<<nobr>>
  <h1>Follow-up checks</h1>
  You
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    are a bit embarrassed by how much you
  <</if>>
  enjoy hearing the stories from the belted girls with partners.  Unlike the single girls, these have all decided to give control
  over to their partner.  Well, that's what the ones with boyfriends do.  The lesbian couples usually get belted together and usually
  sync their belts together, making it so they can only unlock when they are together, or sometimes stay locked, but orgasm together.
  <<set $WomensStudiesBeltAssistant to 1>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But for the belted girls with boyfriends, they give full control over to him, letting him decide when or if she cums, as well as
  control of all the other functions the belts have.  They say this is the safest, since they can't possibly be forced to unlock by
  an attacker, went they can't unlock themselves at all.  Though you doubt that's the real reason most choose to hand control over.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  One of the most popular functions seems to be the "Oral Encouragement Mode", which is almost always enabled by the boyfriend keyholders.
  With this setting the wearer gets teased and eventually brought to the edge of an orgasm while she
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    pleasures her boyfriend with her mouth.
  <<else>>
    sucks her boyfriend's cock.
  <</if>>

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <video src="Part15/Engineer16.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="550"></video>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  And, unless her boyfriend has changed the settings, there's a chance it'll make her orgasm too when her boyfriend does.  They could
  change it to always give her one, or to never give her one.  But we are supposed to recommend they leave it at the default unpredictable
  setting. Something about random ratio, or random reinforcement, or something like that.  It's supposed to be better at making her
  want to
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    keep him happy while she stays locked.
  <<else>>
    suck his cock.
  <</if>>
  We are just supposed to explain to her that it's more fun that way.  Though from their reactions, that doesn't seem to be a lie.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  In fact, they do seem to love it as much as their boyfriends do. Most of the girls report offering
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    oral
  <<else>>
    blow jobs
  <</if>>
  much more frequently now, sometimes even begging to
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    pleasure her boyfriend
  <<else>>
    suck her boyfriend's cock
  <</if>>
  if she is feeling especially horny.  Most say before the belt if she did oral it was part of foreplay, for a special occasion,
  or more frequently than not, it was her boyfriend's idea not hers.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  They report frequently starting with oral, and planning to request to be unlocked for other sex part way through, but that
  it rarely happens that way.  Usually they get so caught up in the moment, that they can't stop until
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    they've brought their boyfriend to completion.
  <<else>>
    they feel their boyfriend's cum fill their mouth.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But even when they do engage in other forms of sex, unlocking is less frequent than you would have expected, especially for the
  wearers in cock cages.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When they do engage in penetrative sex, it's much more common than you would have expected for their boyfriend to keep their
  chastity device on, and instead
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    engage in anal sex.
  <<else>>
    fuck their ass.
  <</if>>
  Orgasms from this are more common from the caged wearers, which makes sense.  Though they report that they are generally still
  nearly as horny after their orgasm as they were before it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <video src="Part16/Class13.webm" autoplay loop muted height="450"></video>
  <video src="Part16/Class14.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="450"></video>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  With both the caged and belted wearers, they report being far more eager to please their boyfriends, sexually and otherwise.
  They see this as a positive thing, and that they feel closer to their boyfriends than they did before.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectSubmissive and $dating.length and !setup.haveGirlfriend()>>
    Hearing them talk about giving control over to their boyfriends, really turns you on.  Hearing them talk about begging him
    for the chance to cum, or having him fuck them with their device still on, even more so.  It's all too much for you to resist,
