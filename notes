I have noticed a bug maybe so I am Roberts slave and part-time model and it comes up after valentines day on the left-hand side

"Inventory

You have a chastity belt, but you aren't currently locked." Debug: Current: Part11MasterBackHome | Previous: Part11MasterBegging |

But on the right, it says "After Master has locked you back in your chastity belt, you head back home. You don’t know when you’ll be out of the belt again. You do your best to clean yourself up with the belt on.

Orgasming tonight has certainly eased the frustration you've been feeling lately. You know the memory of how good it felt will be fresh in your mind for quite a while. But you wonder if that memory will make being locked back in the belt even more frustrating until your next orgasm. Whenever that might be."

You press next morning and on the left it still says

"You have a chastity belt, but you aren't currently locked.

Olivia is your mentor and roommate . Your neighbours are Zack and Josh. You are a slave to Robert.

You work as an Engineer.
You have a side-job as an Anal Porn Actress.
You are a freshman.
You are on academic probation.

Also with the "Watching a Game"

It comes up like this

Dylan, Cassie, and you have fun watching a minor league baseball game. Well, the beer helps. And you enjoy spending time with your brother and sister. But the game does starts to bore you after a while, so you are eager to go when Cassie suggests leaving in the 8th inning.

"Anna, I was planning on hanging out with some of my friends later, do you want to join me|Part14HomeSister?", Cassie asks on the way back to the car. "Or were you wanting to do something with Dylan this evening?" You don't want to miss out on Dylan maybe unlocking you, so you tell her you and Dylan already have plans.

================================================================================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts
- Improving or eliminating academic and fun points ?

Suggestions from tfgames:
- should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
    
Back-end
- Revamping body / side effect system, changing stacked description

Earlier Parts:
- Consider eliminating side-jobs from beginning (still have them at the student loan part)
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate (is this fixed now?)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
- consider adding additional side effect from second implant birth control option.  Triggered every time it prevents a pregnancy
