  <h1>Begging to try again</h1>
  Just when you thought you were going to cum, it fades away.  The tech says something about the treatment having failed, but you know it was so close.
  He has to try again.  But he says it wouldn't help.
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <img src="PartX/Denial1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="500">

  You offer to suck his cock if he just lets you try.  Then you offer
  <<if !$PlayerChastityBelt>>
    your pussy, then
  <</if>>
  your ass.  It does no good. "I'm sorry miss, but there's nothing we can do at this point.  Your implant, and all its side effects are permanent.
  And that includes the orgasm denial side effect.  I feel very sorry for you, but I did warn you about the risks and the low probability of success."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "No.  There's got to be something we can do," you say frantically, still desperate to cum.  "I'll

<<nobr>>
  "I'm sorry," he tells you.  "That might have worked earlier, but now it wouldn't help."

<<nobr>>
  <img src="PartX/Denial2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400" align="left">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  "So... I'll never orgasm again... ever?" you ask trying not to cry.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He doesn't say anything for a moment then tells you, "Well, there's always a chance... a very small one.  One in a thousand, maybe one in ten
  thousand, who knows.  There's always a chance you might orgasm instead of it getting blocked.  So you might still cum a few times."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "A few times... that doesn't sound so... wait, you mean a few times <b><i>ever</i></b> again," you try to stifle your tears. "I guess that's
  something. And it'll still feel good trying, even if I don't orgasm, right?"  He nods in agreement.
  <<if $PlayerProtectionPerfect or $PlayerProtectionPermanent>>
    <br><br>
    He tells you it probably won't affect the likelihood of an orgasm if you disable your implants birth control.  Not anymore anyway.  But you insist

  You then quickly head to the exit, forgetting about the rest of your scheduled appointment.

  <hr>
  You don't hear the conversion between your tech and one of the others after you leave:
  <br><br>
  "Why did you tell her that last part?  There's not been any orgasms reported after that effect triggers like it did for her," the other one
  says to your tech.
  <br><br>
  "Well, it is a new implant, so maybe one might happen eventually, but just hasn't happened yet.  So it is possible," yours replies.
  <br><br>
  "Yeah, but..." his coworker starts.
  <br><br>
  "Anyway, she seemed like she need a little hope at least," your tech says, before the two of them drop the topic and return to working.

  <h1>Trying for relief with Peter</h1>
  <img src="PartX/Denial3.gif" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400" align="left">
  <<set setup.addSex({name:'Peter'})>>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  Having the key to his chastity cage, means you know Peter will come running when you call, especially when you mention how horny you are.  He's
  at your door waiting before you even make it back home.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Your plan was to tease him a bit, then have him eat you out until he managed to make you cum.  You'd offer him the promise of a long-awaited
  orgasm for himself if he succeeded.  But that's not what happens.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You start with stroking his cock through his cage, as you've done many times before.  You want to give him a taste of the pleasure he'll get if he
  succeeds.  You are just wanting his cock to try to get hard, and strain against it's cage, to hear him whimper and beg a few times, and then it'll
  be time to have him focus on you.  For as long as it takes.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But something happens to you when you hear him moan and drops of precum leak from his cock. Though it isn't only the sight of it.  Your sense of
  smell must be heightened or something, because you can smell it too, which triggers a memory of how wonderful it tastes...
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <video src="PartX/Denial4.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="300"></video>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You forget about your plan. You only want to taste Peter's precum.  You think about unlocking him, but you want it sooner than that.  You wrap
  your lips around his cock, cage and all.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="PartX/Denial5.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400" align="left">
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Happiness spreads through you as you feel his precum on your tongue.  You try to suck his cock, to get the real cum to go along with the small appetizer
  of it you've had.  But the cage is going to make that very difficult.  So you quickly insert the key into the lock of Peter's chastity cage,
  [[and turn it|Denial2PeterChastity2]].
<</nobr>>

::Denial2PeterChastity2
<<nobr>>
  <h1>Peter Uncaged</h1>
  You had planned on sucking his cock.  But once you see it, hard and uncaged, you want something else.  You want it inside you.  You beg Peter to
  fuck you.
  <<set setup.addSex({name:'Peter'})>>
  <<set setup.addSex({name:'Peter', vaginal:true})>>
  <<set setup.addSex({name:'Peter'})>>
  <<set setup.addSex({name:'Peter', vaginal:true})>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You aren't sure when the last time Peter's cock was uncaged when you hadn't bound his hands instead.  It's not like he would have refused to go
  back in his cage, or try to stroke himself if you told him not to, but it always added to giving both of you the feeling that you were always in
  control.  He doesn't know the reason for it yet, but Peter can quickly sense the dynamic between you and him has changed.  He is quite happy to
  take advantage of the new circumstances.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  As he slides into you, it feels so amazing.  Why where you keeping this wonderful cock locked up when he would have fucked you every day, several
  times a day, if you had only asked?
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="PartX/Denial7.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="500" align="right">
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You tell him how wonderful his cock feels, and beg him not to stop.  He spanks your ass, which only turns you on more.  He stops thrusting for a moment.
  When you try to thrust back onto his cock, he hold you down so you can't.  He makes you apologize for keeping his cock caged and him denied all the
  time before he starts thrusting again.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You instantly do as he asks, and are quickly rewarded when his cock fills you again.  He tells you to say that you are his little whore.  To say that
  your pussy belongs to him and him alone now.  You say whatever he asks, agree to whatever he wants, anything to keep him from stopping again.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It feels so good, especially as he starts to get closer to cumming.  You know that technician was wrong and you are about to cum any moment, maybe when
  Peter does.  "Cum inside me!  Fuck me!  Don't stop!"  You beg as you hear Peter getting close.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Finally, Peter lets go of your wrists to grab your hips.  He pulls you back, burying his cock deep inside you.  You moan as you feel his cock throb and
  his warm cum start to fill you.  But you don't orgasm.  You feel a soft, warm glow of happiness from knowing the pleasure you gave Peter.  But no orgasm.
  You love the feeling of his cum inside you, but you are still craving an orgasm, even more than when you started.
<</nobr>>

  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  For now though, you are just thinking how long Peter needs to rest before you can coax his cock back to life.  He probably didn't last long enough
  to get you off this time because he'd been denied for so long.  Maybe you'll have better luck a second time.  Or maybe the third.  You'll try as
  many times today as he'll let you.  Hopefully it'll be enough.

  You promised to be loyal to $dating[0], but sometimes he has to work, or sometimes he's just worn out and can't try again.  You know you can't get
  yourself off.  They made it clear there's no chance of that happening.  Not even a tiny one.  But sometimes you can't help it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You've rubbed yourself raw when he was away, trying to get yourself off. $dating[0] has tried everything to make you stop trying.  Throwing away
  most of your toys, and locking the ones that he uses with you away.  He's stopped buying certain vegetables, or anything else that you might try
  to use as a toy.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="PartX/Denial9.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="350" align="left">
  He even found a set of creams they sell now to prevent masturbation.  One cream goes on your clit and lower lips, the other cream is for your hands.
  If you try to touch yourself now, it feels like your clit is on fire.  The jar says it only takes a few minutes to soak into your skin, and then the
  effects last for at least a month.  You don't know if it lasts that long though, because $dating[0] reapplies it for you once a week.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You look forward to it.  Feeling $dating[0]'s gloved hands lovingly rub the cream over your clit, and then inside you, feels so wonderful.  He has
  you apply the hand cream youself, while his latex-covered fingers explore inside you and across your clit, until he's certain it has had time to soak
  in.  After a luxurious bath to make sure there's no excess cream left behind, $dating[0] gives your reward for being such a good girl.  That's
  the part of your weekly ritual you look forward to the most.  Afterwards, he locks the creams and gloves away with the toys while you stay and
  fix your hair and makeup and get ready for the day.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The creams have made sure you've stopped trying to touch yourself.  It only took one time trying, and experiencing that pain, to make sure you
  wouldn't try again.  But when you're home, and $dating[0] is at work still, and you feel that need, you can't help trying to rub yourself on anything
  you can find, just to feel something.

  $dating[0] isn't happy about that.  You've injured yourself a couple times trying to get off, and he worries about you.  You think he's also
  worried that sooner or later, you are going to be unfaithful.  The need will get to great and you'll find the nearest cock when he's away.  You
  wish you could be sure you wouldn't do that.  You know you'd try not to, but you aren't at all confident you'd be able to resist.

  On thing that helps you stay focused is making sure you get a dick frequently enough.  Of course it only helps a bit, since you never
  get off, and usually end up hornier than when you started.  But if you wait too long, it starts being the only thing you can think about.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You've tried using toys to help, but they don't do any good.  They do get you wet and ready for a cock, but that's only helpful if you have one

  If you wait too long between cocks, you start to obsess about it.  When you can get filled next starts to be all you can think about.  You start
  imagining how good it feels when it first starts to go in.  You think about the wonderful feeling when it's fully inside you, filling every inch of you.
  Your eyes roll back a bit as you recall the feeling when he twitches and cums inside you.  You picture exactly how it felt when you came too.

  Well, you also remember that you'd clench down on his cock when you came, as your body tried to get every last drop of cum from him.  That part

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Some of your regular guys know how you get if you'd waited too long.  They love teasing you instead of giving you their cock right away.  They
  make you beg for it, they make you worship their cock.  They make you wait agonizingly long before finally sliding it into you.

  and cumming inside you, might be the only thing that can get you off now.  "They did say it was related to those 'Breeder' pills, right?" she
  comments.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The guy you two bring home isn't upset at all that it's only you he'll be fucking.  He's more than happy to watch eat out $dating[0], both
  before he starts fucking you, and continuing after he begins.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You can't believe how good his cock feels as it slides into you, even better than $dating[0]'s strap-on.  You tell him how wonderful his cock feels,
  and beg him not to stop.  It feels even better as he starts to get closer to cumming.  You know that technician was wrong and you are about to cum any
  moment, maybe when this guy does.  "Cum inside me!  Fuck me!  Don't stop!"  You lift up from eating out $dating[0] to beg as you hear him getting close.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He holds your hips as he gets close, and then thrusts deep into you as he groans.  You moan as you feel his cock throb and his warm cum start to fill
  you.  But you don't orgasm.  You feel a soft, warm glow of happiness from knowing the pleasure you gave him.  But no orgasm. You love the feeling of his
  cum inside you, but you are still craving an orgasm, even more than when you started.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  For now though, you are just thinking how long he needs to rest before you can coax his cock back to life.  Hopefully not long.  It turns out with
  you giving $dating[0] a few orgasms, it doesn't take him long to be ready at all. Maybe you'll have better luck a second time.  Or maybe the third.
  You'll try as many times today as him and $dating[0] are willing to try.  [[Hopefully it'll be enough|Denial5Girlfriend]].

<<nobr>>
  You heard about a support group on campus for orgasm-free girls.  They call themselves "Good Girls" and and have the slogan "Good Girls
  Don't Cum."  Technically, it's not entirely girls, there's a few guys in chastity cages as well, but you all treat them like one of the girls too.  The guy
  that recommended it to you thought it would be a great way for you to help cope with your situation and to find out how other girls are handling
  some of the issues you face.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The first thing you learned is that most of the other girls aren't in exactly your situation.  Almost all of them are physically able to orgasm.
  Some are wearing a chastity belt (or cage) that stops them.  Either one of the new computer ones or just a regular one.  Some of them use 
  <<if $SubjectOrgasmDenialGooWoreOff>>
    the orgasm-blocking gel that the engineering department had used on you last year.
  <<elseif $JobEngineerFormer>>
    an orgasm-blocking gel, made a few years ago by the engineering team you used to work for.
  <<elseif $JobTestSubjectFormer>>
    an orgasm-blocking gel, made by the engineering department that used to test on you.
  <<else>>
    an orgasm-blocking gel, made by the school's engineering department.
  <</if>>
  Others just choose not to orgasm, usually because their boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever has told them they can't without permission.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You admire those girls, that resist touching themselves, and that can even hold back their orgasm when they are getting fucked if they are told not
  to cum.  You certainly wouldn't be able to hold back an orgasm if your body still let you have them.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But the girls choosing this life help you see the benefits being orgasm-free has.  You especially found the list you all made of the benefits of edges
  without an orgasm over having an orgasm.  Of course a few of them don't apply to you, but most are just as true for you as for all the others.

  You promised to be loyal to $dating[0], but sometimes she has to work, or sometimes she's just worn out and can't try again.  You know you can't get
  yourself off.  They made it clear there's no chance of that happening.  Not even a tiny one.  But sometimes you can't help it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You've rubbed yourself raw when she was away, trying to get yourself off. $dating[0] has tried everything to make you stop trying.  Locking away all
  the toys.  Even going as far as not buying certain vegetables, or anything else that you might try to use as a toy.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  She even found a set of creams they sell now to prevent masturbation.  One cream goes on your clit and lower lips, the other cream is for your hands.
  If you try to touch yourself now, it feels like your clit is on fire.  The jar says it only takes a few minutes to soak into your skin, and then the
  effects last for at least a month.  You don't know if it lasts that long though, because $dating[0] reapplies it for you once a week.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="PartX/Denial32.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="650" align="left">
  You look forward to it.  Feeling $dating[0]'s gloved hands lovingly rub the cream over your clit, and then inside you, feels so wonderful.  She has
  you apply the hand cream youself, while her latex-covered fingers explore inside you and across your clit, until she's certain it has had time to soak
  in.  You want $dating[0] to join you in the tub, but she's worried there might be some excess cream in the water, and she doesn't want any on herself.
  But after your bath she takes you into the bedroom and gives you your reward for being such a good girl.  That's the part of your weekly ritual you
  look forward to the most.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The creams have made sure you've stopped trying to touch yourself.  It only took one time trying, and experiencing that pain, to make sure you
  wouldn't try again.  But when you're home, and $dating[0] isn't home yet, and you feel that need, you can't help trying to rub yourself on anything
  you can find, just to feel something.

  $dating[0] isn't happy about that.  You've injured yourself a couple times trying to get off, and she worries about you.  You think she's also
  worried that sooner or later, you are going to be unfaithful.  The need will get to great and you'll find the nearest cock when she's away.  You
  wish you could be sure you wouldn't do that.  You know you'd try not to, but you aren't at all confident you'd be able to resist.

  $dating[0] found out about a support group on campus for orgasm-free girls.  They call themselves "Good Girls" and and have the slogan "Good Girls

  The first thing you learned is that most of the other girls aren't in exactly your situation.  Almost all of them are physically able to orgasm.
  Some are wearing a chastity belt (or cage) that stops them.  Either one of the new computer ones or just a regular one.  Some of them use

    the orgasm-blocking gel that the engineering department had used on you last year.

  Others just choose not to orgasm, usually because their boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever has told them they can't without permission.

  You admire those girls, that resist touching themselves, and that can even hold back their orgasm when they are getting fucked if they are told not

  But the girls choosing this life help you see the benefits being orgasm-free has.  You especially found the list you all made of the benefits of edges
