  First they went over the rules of the hunt with you.  In short, you have to find your way to the target location on your map.  If you're captured, the
  first time, they can use you however they want for a few hours, then release you.  That will make it much harder to win, but you'll still have a chance.
  The second second time you are captured, you lose.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are all getting paid to participate, but the amount depends on how you finish, and if you finish at all.  That will also affect what privileges you
  have during your stay the rest of the summer.  They want to make sure all the prey do their best not to get caught and will punish anyone that doesn't
  try their hardest, or at least if they think they aren't.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The hunt starts tomorrow.  For now, they've stripped you and the other prey of your street clothes to make sure you can't smuggle anything in to help you.
  Tomorrow you'll be given supplies, including clothes, before you are dropped off.  Tonight you just have to wait.  They should be bringing your dinner
  by soon though.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  There's several girls in the cell with you.  They are planning on working together, at least for the first day.  You can [[join them tomorrow|IslandHuntGroup]]
  or you can [[go it alone tomorrow|IslandHuntAlone]]

    The doctor mentioned that the shot he gave you could increase your libido.  "But that will probably just make the hunt that much more fun for you," he
    had added.  Now all you can think about is being tied and used by hunters.  You wonder if that's from the shot or just normal.  You realize now the doctor
    never said how long it would take for the libido effects to wear off.

  You and three other girls decide to work together at first.  At the end it'll be every woman for herself, but at least for today and the first part of
  tomorrow, you are going to be a team.  You know a hunter can overpower any one of you.  But he won't be able to overpower all four of you working together.

  You start off confidently towards your target.  You even take some time to snap a few photos with phone they gave you.  You try to pull up GPS on it to help,
  but they've locked it down, disabling everything except the camera.  Still, you and your new friends will have photos to share later.  Of course, the
  resort has rights to use them in their advertising too.

<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You and your companions stop for a break.  It's just water and an energy bar, but it gives you all a chance to rest, and to talk and joke around a bit.
  You hadn't realized that the sound of your laughter was carrying so well through the woods, but as you rested, two hunters began stalking your group.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  They waited until they had you between them, and then came at you from different directions.  You had planned on the four of you taking on one hunter, but
  you hadn't planned on the hunters working together too.  When they jump out at you, everyone forgets about the plan and fends for themselves.  There's four
  of you, and they can only capture two!

    Of course, you have a few extra pounds compared to the other girls, and they are all faster than you are.  So you don't have any chance of being one of
    the two that gets away.  Before you know it, one of the hunters is on top of you with his arms around you.  Once his partner has captured one of your
    friends, the two of them carry you and her off somewhere to [[do whatever they want with you|IslandHuntGroup3]].
  <<elseif $BodyType == 'Fit'>>
    You are in better shape than the other girls,

      but that doesn't help you.  One of the hunters grabs you from behind before you even think to run.  You're upset at yourself for letting yourself get

  The hunters carry you off to a fenced off area.  There's a house here with a pool.  Maybe it belongs to someone from the resort, but you never see
  the inside of it.  The building the hunters take you to first is an old stone building.  They quickly cut your clothes off and toss them aside before
  tying you up.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  In addition to the two that captured you and your friend, a third was waiting at the camp.  You guess they must be scored or rewarded base on how many girls
  they capture - beyond just the fun they have with you.  They have some sort of quick contest with their hands to decide who loses and then the other two
  each take something from your bag and their other captors.  "Next one's yours", one of the winner tells the loser.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Then the three of them the proceed to use you and her, fucking you, fucking your ass, even fucking you with their tools.
  <<if !$AcademicProbationDenial and $PlayerSideEffectAnal>>
    Even being treated like this, you can't help enjoying their cock in your ass.  They laugh as you cum while they pound your ass over and over again.
  <</if>>
  They even try to humiliate you even more by cumming in your water bottle and making you drink it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  One of them even records you using the camera phone you had, making you say that you are a dirty whore and begging for him to fuck your ass again.
  "I'm sure they'll have this up on the website by the end of the week," he tells you.  You don't care.  You're willing to say whatever he wants if
  it'll keep him from putting your head underwater again.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  After all three of them have had their fun with you and her, they release you both and you [[run off in opposite directions|IslandHuntGroupReleased]]

  After they release you take off on your own.  You are wary of being caught again, but you are probably a bit safter for now.  There's probably three
  hunters back at the compound taking a nap right now - or at least having a beer and waiting.  Still, you don't know how many more are out there.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You keep going until it starts to get dark.  You feel like it'd be a good idea to keep going a while longer, but you just can't.  You are so sore and
  exhausted from your capture, and the walking since then.  And you haven't had anything to drink since the cum-filled water hours and hours ago.

  out for hunters sneaking up on you.
  <<if $BodyType == 'Fit'>>
    You don't know where the others are, but you assume you are making good time compared to them.  You need to stay focused on avoiding being captured though.

  you'll be helpless and vulnerable if you [[squat down in the woods to pee|IslandHuntPee]].
<</nobr>>

  You see an alternative in the distance, there's a small park here.  You are still far from the resort, so you wonder if maybe this is for the staff that live
  on the island.  The part that interests you though is the public restroom.  You're still worried about being caught, but it's in the middle of a large
  cleared area with no hunters visible, so maybe it'll be ok if you [[use the park restroom|IslandHuntRestroom]].

  completely vulnerable, though thankfully you still have you clothes.  You realize someone must have seen you enter and then waited outside for you to leave.

  He asks you where the other girls are.  He thinks you were travelling with other prey, or know where they might be.  You tell him you don't know, but
  he doesn't believe you.  Or maybe he does believe you, but just enjoys trying to make you 'confess'.

  He cuts your pants and underwear off, and pulls your shirt over you face, then he begins spraying you with cold water.  On most of your body, it's just
  uncomfortable, but when he sprays the shirt covering your face, it makes you feel like you are drowning.  You don't know anything, you hadn't seen any
  other prey since the start.  But you start naming places you've passed by,  hoping he'll believe you.

    Your dream is really getting good

    You are sound asleep
  <</if>>
  when hunters grab you.  Before you know it you are bound and helpless and being carried away from your 'safe' hiding spot.
  <<if !$AcademicProbationDenial and $PlayerSideEffectDreams>>
    "The slutty ones, moaning in their sleep, are easy to find," one of them says to the other.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The one not carrying you says, "Since she's aready naked, this is her second capture.  So this ass is ours until the end of the hunt tomorrow."  Then he
  slaps your ass hard and both of them laugh.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It's dark and you are draped over the hunter's shoulder, so you can't see much of where they take you.  But you hear many more hunters around.  This
  must be where they are all staying for the night.  They take you into a building and bind you to some posts on the floor.  "Since you are out of the hunt,
  it won't just be us using you," your captor says as he tightens the straps.  "All the other hunters will want a turn too."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are still thirsty, and meekly ask for water.  "Of course," he says as he holds bottle with a straw up to your mouth.  "No one wants to fuck a dry mouth."
  After you've drank you fill he asks,  "You ready now, slut?  Some of the these guys didn't capture anyone at all today.  So they might want more than one go,"
  the other one adds.  "I hope you weren't planning on sleeping much tonight."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You lose track of how many hunters use you.  Sometimes it's one after another, and sometimes they leave you there.  A few times you've fallen asleep on the
  posts, only to be awoken to the feel of a cock shoved inside you.
  <<if !$AcademicProbationDenial>>
    They laugh and high five each other every time one of them makes you orgasm.  
    <<if $PlayerEasytoOrgasm>>
      That happens frequently thanks to your implant and ability to orgasm so easily. "I wonder who is enjoying this more, us or her?", one of them asks.
    <</if>>
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You have no idea how many hours of passed, or how many loads of cum you've swallowed or been filled with.  But eventually they've all had enough for the
  night.  Or maybe they just want to get some sleep so they are prepared to hunt the other girls tomorrow.  They
  [[lead you off somewhere|IslandHuntSleepLose2]] so you can finally sleep for the night.

<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  They chain you and other captured girl together to a wall in stall meant for some animal.  She's as tired and sore as you are, and you both are eager to
  sleep.  The two of you snuggle together for warmth, though the short chain attaching you doesn't leave much choice anyway.  Eventually you are both asleep.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The next morning you awake and see they've filled a dog bowl with dry cereal and another with water.  You and her are both starving, but they didn't
  bother to unbind your arms.  The two of you do your best eating from the bowls like dogs - which you assume is what your captors wanted to happen.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Thankfully, all either of you need to fill the bucket they left you with is pee.  You both take turns being careful not to miss the bucket or knock it over.
<</nobr>>

  When they get you to the area where the hunt is set to finish, you are locked in a cage up in the air.  Thankfully someone rubs sunscreen into your skin,
  though he expects more than a 'Thank you' in return.  Occasionally someone will come by and give you water or something to eat through the bars of your cage.
  But more frequently it's a hard cock that finds its way between the bars.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He usually makes it clear whether he wants you to contort yourself to suck it for him, or if he's wanting to make use of some other part of your body instead.
  Either way, you do your best to make him happy.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But most of the time, you are just free to watch.  The winner makes it through fully dressed.  You realize she made it two days without being captured once,
  but you couldn't even make it a single day without being captured twice and eliminated.  She stops briefly to look at you and the other losers before heading
  to get something to eat.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  A few more of the early finishes show up with their clothes still on, but most of the rest walk in completely naked.  You feel a little better about yourself
  knowing that they were captured once, either today or yesterday.  For the ones that head straight to the water bottles, you assume it was yesterday.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But there are also many girls led in at the end of rope or leash by hunters.  Some even tied to a post, being carried by two hunters like a roast pig.  They
  lost, just like you.  It just took them a little longer is all.  Eventually the last girls are lead in, and you wait to see [[what is next|IslandHuntLost]]
  for you and the other captured prey.

<<nobr>>
  You realize why he wanted your shirt tight when he reaches into his bag and pulls out a large candle and lights it. He frightens you with with, holding
  the flame in your face, before dripping hot wax onto your breasts.  You can't move much anyway, and are scared if you do you might get burned, so you
  just endure the flashes of pain as the hot wax hits.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Once you've gotten used to that, he moves to dripping the wax on your stomach, your bare legs.  When he pulls your panties out away from your body, you
  can't help but try to move away, knowing what comes next.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Once he's had his fun, and bits of wax cling to your body, he gets scissors from his bag.  "I don't think we need these anymore," he says as he cuts away

  He takes advantage of your helplessness by pulling out a whip from his bag and working over your ass.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Once he's satisfied your ass is red enough, or more likely once whipping you has made his cock hard enough, he drops the whip.  He ties one of your legs
  in the air, leaving you completely open to him, then slides his cock into you. Feeling how wet you he tells you, "I see the little slut likes getting
  her ass worked over.  Maybe I'll do it again when I'm finished."

  inside you again and again.  He stays there a moment, before he pulls out of you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He gathers his things as you stand there with his cum leaking out of you.  Once he's finished he cuts you loose.  "Have a fun rest of the night!",
  he says as you run off naked into the darkness.  Eventually you find a new hiding spot and lay down again to get what sleep you can before morning.

  The staff here will be more than happy to keep you busy at no charge."

  <<if $HuntWinner>>
    For the week you
  <<else>>
    You
  <</if>>
  are used by different guests every night, or sometimes just for a few hours.  Some of them love punishing you, others just want to use your body.
  <<if $AcademicProbationDenial>>
    None of them are much concerned by your lack of orgasms.
  <<else>>
    Most aren't much concerned about whether you orgasm or not.  Some make you ask permission first.  Some don't let you at all, or punish you if you do.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Sometimes it's not even the guests but one of the staff.  They seem to especially enjoy fucking and punishing someone like you, someone they'd be expected
  to cater to if you weren't submissive.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You have no say over how you are used, or by whom, and you love it.  You lose track of how many guests, and staff you've served by the end of the week.
  At the end
  <<if $HuntWinner>>
    of the
  <<else>>
    each
  <</if>>
  week, they let you know how much money you've earned in your rental fees.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It's not that much considering how much you worked for it.  But you realize the resort's cut would be much more,
  <<if $HuntWinner>>
    so they'd be happy if you wanted to be submissive again the following week.  Though, you are still able to
    [[choose how you want to spend the next week|IslandHuntPetSuit]].  It's actually the first choice you've had since a week ago. 
  <<else>>
    so they are probably making a profit off of your 'free' stay at the resort.  But each week they give you a choice, really it's the only choice you
    get each week.  You can be a submissive again, or you can [[go back to being a pet|IslandHuntPetSuit]].
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

  <i>Being used like this

    all week
    <<set $PlayerSideEffectSubmissive += 1>>
  <<else>>

  <<set setup.addInventory('costumes', 'latex bondage kitten')>>
  You've been looking at a certain item in the display case for weeks now.
  <<if setup.haveInventory('costumes', 'latex kitten')>>
    You have something similar, but much this one is so much more exciting
  <</if>>
  It's a locking latex catsuit, complete with cute little ears on the hood.  And once you're locked into it, someone else - someone with the key, will need
  to let you out.  Assuming they want to let you out.  All you'll be able to do is unzip the conveniently placed zipper when needed.  If it ever even gets zipped
  closed in the first place that is. They may want to use you enough that it isn't worth the trouble to zip it up at all.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  At the end of the week, when it's time to choose how you want to spend the next week, you decide it's time to stop just fantasizing about the suit.  You let
  them know you want to buy it with some of your prize money from the hunt.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Of course.  And I expect you'll be putting it on immediately?", he phrases it as a question, though it's clear it's your only option.  Not that you'd want
  to do anything other than exactly that anyway.  "As you've been a pet previously, you know the rules.  You're trained enough I expect that a shock collar
  isn't needed, and speaking isn't really an option in the suit anyway, except when your mouth panel is removed for meals... or for other reasons," he explains
  as he helps you into your new suit.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He sees your surprise when you see that the mouth panel has a dildo gag built in.  "Are you feeling a little nervous about that gag.  Well a little practice
  should help.  On your knees.  Now."  A real cock in your mouth is something you are much more familiar with, and you quickly get to work on his.  Once he
  cums for you, he immediately slides the dildo in to replace his cock.  You tongue slides along dildo as you swallow the last drops of his cum.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He looks at how many locks would be needed for your suit and then pulls a different set of gloves out.  "These will work better," he says as he replaces the
  gloves you are wearing.  The new ones don't have individual fingers in them, preventing you from working the zippers or buckles on your suit yourself.  "There.
  No locks or keys needed now.".  He walks you out front and changes you near the front desk and places a sign by you that says 'Ask about renting me!'  "You
  shouldn't have to wait long," he tells you.  And if you do, then someone will take you down to the pound for storage tonight."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He's right, you don't wait long.  After he rents you, he leads you back to his room.  He doesn't even bother removing your gag and instead fucks you from
  behind.  Afterwards, it takes you a couple attempts, but you manage to let him know you are hungry and thirsty.  He orders room service for you both.
  When you are done with your meal, he's ready for more fun, and now your mouth is conveniently available.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Once he's done with you, he takes you back up front.  It's late by then and they take you down the pound for the night.  They strip you out of your suit,
  put a regular collar on you, and then lock you into a cage next to the other caged pet girls.  "Don't worry, we'll clean your suit for you and you'll go back
  in it tomorrow morning when you go up for rent again," the man locking your cage tells you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't know how many different guests have checked you out by the end of the week.  As fun as the week was, you've decided your new suit would be more fun
  in short durations.  Wearing it every day is a bit too much.  You think [[a simple collar|IslandHuntSubmit]], might be better most of the time.

<<nobr>>
  You love not being in control, and your collar makes sure that you never are.  Whether your temporary owner is a guy who wants you all to himself, a couple
  wanting to add a little excitement, or just one of the staff making use of you between guests, you don't get a say in it.  You can't ask questions you can
  only do as you are told.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You can't tell anyone, but your favorite is always the couples.  For some reason it's even hotter for to be ordered to suck a mans cock by his own wife or
  girlfriend.  You love the feel of her hands shoving your head further down his cock.  You can only obey when she tells you to offer your pussy or ass to
  him while she watches.  You can't beg for a turn, but can only watch in envy when she decides she wants his cock for herself.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You can't speak, but the hungry look in your eyes speak for themselves.  They are always willing to let you lick them clean after their husband or boyfriend
  cums on or in them.  They'll make sure your tongue finds their clit too if he came before she wanted him too.  And she knows that watching you and her together
  will get him hard and ready to go again sooner, which makes everyone happy.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $HuntWinner or $HuntFinished>>
    The resort still gives you the option to go back to being submissive,
    <<if $HuntWinner>>
      or even just a regular guest,
    <</if>>
    but why would you want to?  You love being a pet.  It's the only real choice you have each week, and the only chance to speak you have.  But you don't
    use it.  Each week you remain silent and point to your collar, letting them know [[you want to stay a pet for another week|IslandHuntSubmit2]].
  <<else>>
    If it wasn't for the ebb and flow of guests, you wouldn't even realize when [[one week changes|IslandHuntSubmit2]] to the next.  For you each day is
    the same, trying to please whoever your owner is that day.

  You have a different 'owner' every time a [[new guest decides to rent you out|IslandHuntSubmit3]].  But you think of the resort, and the people that
  take care of you there as your real owners.  It always make you happy when they tell you what a good girl you are.  You are never disobedient, except
  when you know the guest wants you to be disobedient so he can punish you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  They are happy with all the money they are making from you too.  They say you are getting some of that as well, but you haven't bothered to check,
  it's not like you've needed money since you put on your pet collar.  The few minutes they sometimes give you on the computer, you just use to let
  friends and family know you are doing fine and loving your job as an 'event coordinator' at the resort, even if it keeps you too busy to email
  very often.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Sometimes they decide to reward you with a special treat.  Every pet loves a good massage and a bit of pampering at the groomers.  Even if they take
  off your collar, you are a good pet and don't speak.  You always glad when they put it back on though, you feel naked without it.  Especially if they
  give you a little kiss and whisper "good girl", in your ear like your favorite masseuse usually does.

  When you are with two people at a time, it's usually a man and a woman. Most of the guys that come here together don't have any interest in you.  They
  sometimes rent one of the male pets from the pound.  It always makes you happy when one of the horny boy dogs that had been howling at you when you are
  brought in gets a home.  Seeing him fitted with a chastity cage and then led off to get both holes filled all night makes you happy for him.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But sometimes, two straight friends both come as guests.  Maybe for fun, or to bond as friends, or just to save money, they sometimes rent one pet
  to share.  You are always happy when it's you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You love being filled and then pulled from two directions.  You usually leave a mess and need someone to give you a good bath before you can be sent
  to another guest. But it's worth it with how happy it makes your temporary owners.

  You've barely realized how much time has passed, but they let you know the summer is coming to an end.  The resort's manager lets you know that you've been one
  of their more popular pets recently.  Most of their rental pets are young college girls like you, and will be going home.  "The weather is nice here year-round
  though, so there's a constant flow of guests, including single-men.  And we'd love to have you stay to help entertain them."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He lets you know you'll get a higher percentage of your rental fee, deposited into a bank account for you.  You'll still be a pet except for when you have a
  week off.  And your cage and food, if you aren't with a guest, will be free.  So the money should start to add up since you won't be spending any of it.

    After weeks of being submissive, and then being a pet again, you find his offer very tempting.  The thought of signing the contract he has for you and
    [[giving up control and staying here|IslandCollared]] is almost irresistible for you.  But a small part of your mind remembers your friends back at school and
    you family back home, and you wonder if maybe you should [[decline his offer|Part14ReturningFromIsland]].
  <<else>>
    You are overjoyed at his offer.  After how much you've loved your weeks as a pet, you couldn't imagine telling him no.  Once you accept the offer and sign
    the contract he gives you, you are [[led off to get your permanent collar|IslandCollared]].

  The campus isn't open today, but you are able to go online to drop the classes you had enrolled in for next semester and withdraw from the university.
  <<if $AcademicProbationDenial>>
    You also send an email to your dean and the X-Change office at the school, letting them know you aren't a student any longer, and asking to have your

  Your pulse quickens when the sturdy metal collar clicks shut.  You know there's no way to get it off without their special tool.  Not that you'd ever want it
