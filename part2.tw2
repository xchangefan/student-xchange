	Hannah kept talking about how stimulating the piercing will be and how hot it would look.  She reminds you that
	with the medicine they'll give you, it will be healed and ready for action in a couple days, not the weeks it used to
	take.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	She definitely had you convinced.  You weren't quite as sure about the deal she worked out with the piercer though.
	You think about how you've only been a woman for a few hours, and you're doing this already.  But Hannah reassures
	you.  She tells you that you have a beautiful body, why not use it to your advantage when you can.  And if he's
	ok with the deal, and you're ok with the deal, then what's wrong with it?  You agree.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	She's still a bit worried you might back out, so she has you go first.  She talks you through giving what she assumes
	is your first blowjob.  You're a bit unsure of yourself, but quickly pick up signs of what feels good for him.
	<<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>
		You soon see what they meant when they told you about your oral side effect.  Having his cock in your mouth just feels
		so... right.  The way it slides across your tongue, it sends a warm feeling down your spine, you could do this all day.
		But clearly he can't.
	<</if>>
	It isn't long until you are feeling his cum hitting your tongue and your throat.
	<<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>
		They were so right about what the taste would be like for you now.  Your eyes rollback for a second as you savor it.
	<</if>>
	You swallow every drop, just like Hannah instructs.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	You weren't expecting to get as turned on as you did.  You're tempted to sneak off somewhere to masturbate, but Hannah quickly
	coaxes you up onto the chair and your feet into the stirrups.  You feel so open and exposed, and you know both of them
	can see how turned on you are.  Your thoughts of masturbating are soon gone though as you feel the sharp pain of the piercing.
	It's gone after just a second though. He gives you a few pills to take and some cleaning supplies, and explains how to use them,
	and repeats that you shouldn't have any sex or masturbate for at least two days.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	"I can't have sex for two days after my piercing?", Hannah confirms.  "In that case, how soon BEFORE my piercing am I
	allowed to have sex?", she asks as she feels to see if the piercer has recovered from his previous orgasm.  As you watch
	him fuck her to her last orgasm for the next 48 hours, you feel a bit of envy, knowing you'll have to wait at least that long
	before you can have your first orgasm as a woman.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	Once he's done, he tosses his condom in the trash and washes up while Hannah climbs into the chair for her piercing.
	When she's done the two of you finish up your shopping before [[heading back|Neighbours2]] to your room.  On the way you run into
	a couple of the other new girls and their mentors.  You and Hannah secretly smile to each other while the others talk about their
	dresses and show off their ear piercings.
