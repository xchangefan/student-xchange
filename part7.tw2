  You are about to start packing for the holiday break when Barry comes in and asks for a favor.  "$playerName, I picked out a gift for
  my girlfriend back home, and I wanted to see if it's going to fit her before I leave.  The store is here in town so I can exchange it
  on my way out if it doesn't."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You raise an eyebrow when you find out he has a girlfriend back home.  You are pretty sure that wasn't her on Halloween, or any of
  the girls you've seen go into his room.  But maybe they have an open relationship, or just got back together.  Or maybe she's found
  out he's been cheating and that's why he got her a special gift.  Regardless, it's not your problem.
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <img src="Part7/Barry.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="650" align="left">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  "Anyway," Barry continues.  "She's pretty close to your size, so if you could try it on and see if it fits, and give me a woman's
  opinion of it, that be great."  You tell him you'd be happy to help.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He steps out of his room so you can put it on.  When he comes back he says "Wow, it looks great!"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You tell him it's a bit snug, but that you guess it's probably supposed to be.  "And it's shorter than any dress or skirt I would
  wear," you tell him.  "But if your girlfriend likes to show a lot of leg, then she'll probably be ok with that."  You keep adjusting
  the dress, pulling the hem down, but every time you move a bit it seems to creep right back up again.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Thanks," Barry tells you.  "Maybe we should get a second opinion about the length then.  I don't want to get her something that will
  make her uncomfortable.  I'd also like to see what it looks like in daylight.  It's always so dim in these dorms."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You and him head down the hall towards the exit.  You blush a bit and say, "the guys seem to like how tight fitting it is."  You get
  even more leering looks when you get outside.  It excites you a bit.  You wonder if you should wear tight clothes and short skirts
  more often.  You doubt Faith or Pastor Mark would approve though.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You and Barry are outside when you spot one of your friends.  You head over to ask for her opinion, when you happen to glance down
  at yourself.  That's when you notice that the dress is nearly transparent in the sunlight!  It had just looked white back in the dorm!
  You are suddenly aware that you've been walking around almost naked.  No wonder all the guys were staring, they could see everything!
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You turn around and Barry is already gone.  You try to head back in the door you came out of, but your keycard is back upstairs, and
  you can't get back in that door.  You have to go all the way around the building to the main entrance to get back in.  When you get
  back upstairs Barry starts laughing.  "That was amazing!" he tells you. 
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You start off furious with him for tricking you.  But then he says, "Don't tell me you didn't enjoy it.  I saw how much you were loving
  all the attention you were getting, don't deny it."  You can't, you were loving it - before you realized how much you were showing at
  least.  And don't tell me you weren't turned on once you realized you were nearly naked outside.  I could see it on your face as I
  watched you run around trying to get back in the building."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You calm down, because you know he was right about both parts.  You still aren't happy about getting tricked though.  "Why don't you
  keep the dress as a Christmas present from me?" he tells you.  "It's not like I have a girlfriend back home.  I just saw the dress and
  bought it to see if I could get you to wear it."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You forgive him, mostly at least.  And thank him for the "dress".  You head back to your room to [[start packing|Part7Pack1Main]].
  You make sure to pack your new dress.  Mainly so Faith doesn't find it, but part of you is already fantasizing about if you could wear
  it somewhere back home.

	 "I have a number of clients.  Wealthy clients...  That would be interested in adopting your child.  They would, of course,
