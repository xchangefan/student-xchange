<h1>Acceptance Letter</h1>
<<nobr>>
  <<set $StoryKeysLearn to "">>
	You are excited when the response from your first-choice school arrives.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	You weren’t sure if your scores and grades would be good enough, and you had no idea how you’d ever pay for it, but you applied anyway since
	it was the university you’d always dreamed of attending. You’re thrilled to find out that not only were you accepted, you were offered a
	scholarship that covers your tuition! There’s just once catch. The offer is contingent on your participation in their Student X-Change Program.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	You had seen that mentioned and checked the box saying you were interested. If any of your family had asked about it you would have told them
  that you had mistakenly thought the <i>"Student X-Change Program"</i> was some sort of semester abroad when you applied.  But you knew exactly
  what it was.  But now that you are really looking at spending your entire four years at college as a woman, it is a lot more real than it
  was when you applied!
<</nobr>>

<img src="Part1/Start1A.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="600">

<<nobr>>
	Whether you are excited or scared now at that prospect (or perhaps both), you decide you can’t pass up the offer. You figure spending four years
	as a woman is certainly better than going to a different school and mountains of student loans. Maybe it will be a learning experience too.
	Like their brochure says:
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    We invite you to join us for four years that will change your life forever!
    <br><br>
    You can learn about the world at any university, but here you'll learn even more about yourself!
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<img src="Part1/Start1B.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="600">

<<nobr>>
You continue reading their letter:
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    Congratulations on your acceptance to our university. And thank you for your willingness to participate in our Student X-Change Program.
    <br><br>
    This program serves several purposes. First, it is an FDA trial of a new implantable form of X-Change being offered by the X-Change Corporation.(*). But also it also helps promote understanding between genders and helps balance campus demographics.
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
The letter goes on and on for a while, your eyes skim over most of it until the end:
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Additional details will be provided at freshman orientation. We look forward to seeing you!
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Of course you are going to share the good news about your admission and your scholarship with your family.
  You just aren't sure if you want to share the news about the X-Change trial with your family before you've
  actually changed.  It's really just your dad you are worried about.  He's seemed very judgmental of you in
  the past when you'd expressed your feminine side at all.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He'll probably know better than to try to tell you not to do it at all.  But he might
  [[try to take control|StartTalkParents]] some other way, like he usually does.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Or, maybe it would be easier to not have that conversation now.  Or you can  
  [[wait to tell|Start2]] them about the trial until after you've already changed.  Then they'll be nothing he
  can do.  You'll have to wait to tell your mom and siblings too then, since news this big would probably make
  it to your father if you told anyone.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <span style="font-size: 50%">*Please see the enclosed disclosures regarding the risks of your participation including risks of permanency and possibility of side effects. Also enclosed are required financial disclosures regarding compensation the university receives for facilitating the trial.</span>

<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You see your mother looking at you strangely after you tell them about the X-Change trial.  "No.  No, I'm not upset,"
  she tells you.  "I'm just imagining what a beautiful young lady you'll be the next time we see you."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I wouldn't say I'm 'upset' either," you father tells you.  "I think we all knew you were going to be taking X-Change
  sooner or later."  You start to say something, but you know it's true.  You just hadn't realized it was obvious to
  others how much you'd thought about taking a pink pill before.  He is also less upset by this than you had been
  expecting. 
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But you get concerned when your father tells you, "I do have some concerns though."  But you are relieved as he
  adds, "But I understand this is important to you, and so I won't stand in your way as long as you promise to comport
  yourself as a proper young lady at school."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You bristle at that, finally understanding a bit more some of the complaints your sister Cassie has shared with
  you about your father's treatment of her.  But you don't say anything and just try to be happy that he isn't trying
  to stop you. "Of course, I promise I will behave myself."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Wonderful," he says.  "Just let me go through the paperwork when we get home to make sure there's nothing amiss there.
  I'll give them a call with any concerns I still have."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are so relieved as you finish your breakfast with your parents.  This went much better than you had worried it might.
  After breakfast, you finish packing so you are ready when it's time to head to campus.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Before your leave, your dad goes over what he discussed with the X-Change people, and what you need to do
  at your orientation.  When you object to some of his choices he 'explains' why his choices were better for you than
  what you had initially thought.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  While you know he is trying to help, you are annoyed that he is trying to control your life.  Though you are also
  strangely a bit happy that maybe it means he is already accepting you as a daughter, since Cassie has been
  complaining about him treating her like this for years.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He tries to explain his reasons for what him and the X-Change people decided for you, but some of the 'reasons'
  seem more for the benefit of your 'future husband' than you.  You aren't even sure if you'll be interested in men or
  women yet!  You've heard people sometimes change that too after taking X-Change.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  In the end, you realize it's going to be much easier if you just go along with his 'suggestions', and
  [[do things his way|Start2Father]].  Besides, it's not like you don't like what he's planned for you.  And his promise to
  pay for a new wardrobe to go with your new body softens the blow of giving in to his wishes as well.

  You wonder if you are the only one that already knows most of this stuff.  Thankfully your dad read through it all and
  told you all the important bits already.  Most of the other guys in the room look like they might be learning some of this
  stuff for the first time.

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	"After graduation, what you do will be up to you.  Some of you may want to change back, and some of you may find you prefer life as a woman."
  After a long talk with your father, you realized you are one of the later.  You had been telling yourself at first that you
  might want to change back after graduation.  But your father said it was obvious to everyone you were never meant to be a man.
  And he also seemed sure if you were holding on to the thought that you were only going to be a woman for four years, you'd
  "go wild" to try to experience everything in those four years.

  the not changing back part, but your father was very concerned with the pregnancy part.  You don't know why, you could always
  get an abortion if that happened.  But thankfully they have an option so even that won't be necessary.  You assume they'll get to that soon.

  "The standard is the one they have the most experience with, so you are less likely to have

  "You'll likely have a much easier time finding a husband... or wife."  He adds the 'or wife' at the end,

  He lists a bunch of other reasons he thinks it's the best choice for you, ending with what he considers
  an afterthough, "And it will be much easier for you to find clothes you like."  You start thinking about
  all the different kind of clothes you'll be able to wear as a woman.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I see that appeals to you," he says knowing how to remove any lingering doubts you might have.  "I tell
  you what.  When you come home for Christmas, I'll send you and Cassie to the mall with my credit card and
  let you both pick out a bunch of new clothes for your new body.  How does that sound?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It sounds great.  Especially since he'd already convinced you about three reasons earlier.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  After you and him had talked, your dad worked with the X-Change people to get everything setup in advance to
  minimize the chance of any unexpected side effects.  They said some would be unavoidable, but that it was
  easier to select which ones they'd be since they'd be setting your implant up to be permanent from the start.

  Your father was insistent about this next part: birth control.  "I'd prefer you not be having sex at all yet, but I'm not
  stupid.  I know you probably will," he had told you.  "And don't even try to tell me you'd only be interested in other
  girls.  I'm not even sure if that's true now, and almost certainly won't be after your change."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Looking over the birth control options that were available had, he didn't think you could be trusted to use any of them
  consistently, even the birth control pill.  The experimental built-in birth control option was the only one he thought
  you'd be able to rely
  on.

  That option virtual guaranteed you wouldn't get pregnant.  And you didn't have to worry about condoms, taking a pill, pulling-out, or
  anything. They said they'd only be able to [[activate it|ExperimentalPregnancy][$ExperimentalPregnancyOption to 2]] now, before your
  first cycle started.  Your father did warn you it was likely to cause a side effect or two.

	We won’t know for sure what your body type will be until after your change, and then you’ll have that body for at least the next four

	I think they all turn out beautifully, but some people are hoping for something specific. Or thet want something they know their DNA isn’t
	going to give them.  If that’s what you want, then I can tweak some settings a bit and customize it for you.  It works every time, you'll
	get exactly the look you want, but it causes side effects. The side effects won’t affect what you look like though, and some people actually
	enjoy theirs. It’s up to you though.

	<h1>Pregnancy Prevention</h1>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
	I hope you are each thrilled with your new body.  I think you each turned out as beautiful young women.  Of course, you've already
	given us the name you want to use with your new body.  But we find sometimes, after you are actually in your new body, a different
	name calls out to you.  So if anyone wants to choose a new name, let us know and we'll change it for you before we send the forms to
	the registration office.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The name you've decided on is: </i> <<textbox "$playerName" $playerName>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	But now that you are young women, there’s something I need to discuss with you: pregnancy.  Maybe you weren’t interested in men before,
	so you think this discussion doesn’t apply to you. Trust me, you might feel differently now.  Many participants find their sexuality much
	more fluid than it used to be after their change.
<</nobr>>
<img src="Part1/PregPrevent1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450"><img src="Part1/PregPrevent2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450">

<<nobr>>
	But if you’re going to be having sex with men, at all, and want the chance to change back to your old body after graduation, then
	you’ll need to avoid getting pregnant in your new body.  Becoming pregnant will make your change irreversible.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	If you actually do [[want to get pregnant|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionTry to 1]], then you can skip the rest of this talk.
<</nobr>>

<img src="Part1/PregPrevent3.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450"><img src="Part1/PregPrevent4.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450">

<<nobr>>
	Even if you know already that you want this body forever, I’d recommend waiting on motherhood until after graduation. College can be stressful
	enough without starting a family at the same time.  But it's your body, so the decision is yours.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	Most forms of control aren't compatible with the trial you are participating in, the only standard options available are
	[[condoms|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionCondoms to 1]]
	and
	[[birth control pills|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionPill to 1]]
	Let us know what you choose. Make sure you are diligent about whichever you use though. One time without a condom, or a single missed pill
	could be all it takes.
  <<if settings.abortionAllowed>>
    If you get pregnant, of course you'll have options, but changing back to your old body won’t be one of them.
  <<else>>
    Also, be warned, the law may be different where you are from, But unfortunately in this state, if you get pregnant, carrying the baby to term is the only option.
    Of course regardless of where you, getting pregnant will remove the option of changing back to your old body in the future.
  <</if>>

<img src="Part1/PregPrevent5.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450"><img src="Part1/PregPrevent6.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450">

<<nobr>>
  Of course it's up to you.  You could also [[ask the guy to pull out|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionWithdraw to 1]] before he ejaculates.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Of course, it's your body now, so if you [[don't want to use any form of birth control|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionNone to 1]] then
  that's your choice.  But if even if you aren't planning on having sex, or not having it with guys, the pill can still help reduce or eliminate
  your period.  But it's up to you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	There is one additional option.  There’s an experimental feature on your implant we can activate for you.  It might prevent pregnancy and
	eliminate your periods.  Let us know if [[you would like to hear more about it|ExperimentalPregnancyChoice]].
  There’s a good chance it will help, and a small chance that it will make things worse.

  Your implant specialist then goes over the features that your father selected for you and the ones that he rejected.
  Of course, you and him already discussed all of these before you'd left home.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	"Your implant also has several options that can make your experience as a woman either a little easier, or more fun. Don’t worry,
	unlike the experimental birth control option, these always work as intended."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	"Let see the ones you implant has enabled."
<</nobr>>

  <br>
	"Unlike most women, you won’t have to worry about shaving your legs, or anything else. The hair on your head is all that will ever grow."
  <br>
  Your father said that this feature will make your life much easier, and make your future husband happy too.
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
	<img src="Part1/BodyFeatureWeight.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="350" align="left">
  <span id="WeightControl"><<print "Weight Control (selected)">></span>

  "The implant will control your metabolism. You tell us what weight to set it at, and no matter how much you eat, you won’t gain past that.  Though if you ever get pregnant, it will temporaily adjust your set point up an appropriate amount."
  <br>
  Your father thought this would be another one that you and your future spouse would appreciate.  He said that your husband would especially appreciate it after you've been together for a decade or two.  You wonder if he was commenting on the few pounds your mom has put on since they first met.
</p>

	"The university suggested this one to the X-Change team. You’ll only need a couple hours sleep each night. You can use all the extra time you have to study more. (Ha ha, sorry, I have to say that part.)"
  <br>
  Your father said the extra hours in the middle of the night would just be extra hours to get into trouble, so this one wasn't selected.
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
	<img src="Part1/BodyFeatureEasyO.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="350" align="left">

	"It’s usually harder to orgasm as a woman than as a man. But you won’t ever have that problem."

  Your father said if you want to be a woman, you have to take the good with the bad, and that it isn't worth more side effects just to make getting off a bit easier.
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">

	"You’ll be amazed when you have your first orgasm as a woman anyway. But if you pick this option, it’ll be even more powerful whenever you orgasm."
  <br>
  Your father was convinced this one would turn you into a giant slut, though he didn't use those exact words.  He vehmently rejected you getting this one.  Hopefully the natural ones will still be amazing, you hope.
</p>

<<nobr>>
  Your father worked with them to make sure the [[side effects|FatherSettingsPermanent]] that got triggered for you wouldn't
  negatively impact your education, or your future marriage.

  "Excellent!", the technician says.  "There's actually two different options we can try out.  They both only work now, before your first menstrual cycle
  has started.  If you ever decide you want to conceive, just come in and let us know.  We can trigger you to start ovulating that day.  But we won't be
  able to reactivate these options after your pregnancy.  So you'll have to use one of the traditional means after that."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "[[The first option|ExperimentalPregnancy][$ExperimentalPregnancyOption to 1]] works as intended about 75% of the time.  If it works for
  you, then it will be as effective as taking the pill, except you never have to worry about forgetting about it.  And sometimes it's
  even more effective.".  He doesn't go into details on what happens the other 25% of the time.  
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Birth control is a frequently requested feature, especially in college settings, so our engineers have been working to improve this feature's effectiveness.
  They have a [[new version available|ExperimentalPregnancy][$ExperimentalPregnancyOption to 2]] that is 100% effective at preventing pregnancy.  But there
  is a 50% chance it can generate some other unrelated side effects.  If you definitely don't want to get pregnant, then this is the option for you.  Though,
  if you are wanting to change back after graduation, you might want to think hard before choosing this option.  Causing your change to become permanent is
  one of the possible side-effects."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "With either, there have been some reports of increased sex drive.  But it's hard to determine how much of that is because of the birth control option directly,
  and how much is just because of the freedom to have fun without the risk of pregnancy.  I'm sure it's mostly the latter. But at any rate, it's not anything
  users complain about, but we are required to mention it.  More importantly though, both options' contraceptive effects start immediately.  And after a month
  or two, your periods should stop or become much lighter as well."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "And, if or when you ever decide you want to conceive, just come in and let us know.  We can trigger you to start ovulating that day.  We won't be able to
  reactivate the experimental option though, so you'll have to use one of the traditional means after that."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Or, if you've changed your mind and want to choose a more traditional option, like 
  [[pulling out|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionWithdraw to 1]],
  [[condoms|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionCondoms to 1]],
  [[the pill|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionPill to 1]],
  [[or nothing at all|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionNone to 1]]

  There’s almost no chance you’ll get pregnant now.  They say if you ever do want to conceive, let them know and they

  Well, [[it worked.|BodyOptionalFeatures]]  But remember, there is still a small chance of pregnancy, similar to if you were on the pill, except without the
  risk of forgetting to take it.  They say if you ever do want to conceive, let them know and they
  can deactivate it.  But once it's deactivated, they can't reactivate it.

  Oh... Um.... Well, it appears you are part of that 25% I mentioned.  As you were informed this is still an experimental feature.  Activating it did have an
  effect on your cycle, but not the one we had intended.  You are going to have a longer fertile period each month, so your chances of pregnancy are actually
  higher than normal.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  On the bright side, it will be much easier to conceive when you are ready to start a family.  Some of the others that have had this happen have just
  taken it as a sign and decided to [[start trying to conceive right away|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionTry to 1]].  Of course if not, then
  [[condoms|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionCondoms to 1]] or [[pulling out|BodyOptionalFeatures][$PlayerProtectionWithdraw to 1]] are still
  options.  Hormonal birth control is not going to be effective for you however.
