  <h1>Belt Purchase</h1>
  Congratulations on your decision to lock you wearer in one of our belts. Please select the purchase option that you are interested in.
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <h2>Owner Options</h2>
  All owner-purchase options require full, up-front payment at full price.
  If you will have multiple wearers, please contact us for information regarding multi-belt discounts.
  <ul>
    <li>Shipment to Owner</li> 
    <i>(This is the best option when you and your wearer live together or see each other in person frequently.)</i><br/>
    Your belt will be shipped to you for your own delivery to your wearer at a time of your choosing. 
    <br/><br/>
    <li>Shipment to Wearer</li>
    <i>(This the best option for long-distance relationships that want locking as soon as possible.)</i><br/>
    Your belt will be shipped to your wearer directly for them to put on themselves. Everything is pre-configured for your wearer. All they need to do is put
    on the belt. 
    <br/><br/>
    <li>Marketplace Purchase (as Owner)</li>
    <i>(This is a great option if you want to be an owner, but don't have a prospective wearer yet.)</i><br/>
    You can purchase a belt for one of our Wearers wanting to use the "Marketplace Purchase" option. Look through the profiles of the prospective wearers, and the
    term-length and limits they are requesting. If any meet your needs, select them and purchase their belt and they will be exclusively yours for the term agreed to.
    If you find a prospective wearer that interests you, but don't like the term or limits requested, feel free to suggest different ones, they will often agree to
    change them. (At the the end of the agreed term, wearer will be given a one-time option to unlock and clear the owner, or to keep you as their owner)
    <br/><br/>
    <li>Gift Card/Code</li>
    You can pre-pay for a belt, and generate a purchase code. You can provide this code to your wearer by whatever means you like, or we can send it to them on your
    behalf (or anonymously if selecting the Mystery Owner Option). Then they will have the belt shipped directly to themselves, with you pre-configured as owner.
  </ul>

  <b>Note</b>: For all owner-purchased belts, regardless of purchase method, the belt will be pre-configured with the purchasing owner. Whether the belt is locked or unlocked,
  this cannot be changed without your permission. (For Sponsored Purchase: when unlocked, the wearer can choose to clear the owner after the completion of the agreed term)

  <h3>Mystery Owner Option</h3>
  If you want to keep your identity secret from the wearer, select the "Mystery Owner" option when making your purchase. Your name will not be included in any
  information sent to the wearer, and your profile details will be hidden from them as well. By default, they will be able to message you from the wearer app, but will
  only see you displayed as "My Owner".

  <h2>Wearer Options</h2>
  All owner-purchase options require full, up-front payment at full price.
  If you will have multiple wearers, please contact us for information regarding multi-belt discounts.
  <ul>
    <li>Full self-payment</li>
    <i>(This is the best option when you want full-control over the configurations for your self-locking. It also is the only option that allows you to get
    your belt now, but start wearing it at some time in the future.)</i><br/>
    Your belt will be shipped to you to wear at a time of your choosing. 
    <br/><br/>
    <li>Gift Card/Code</li>
    If you have been provided with a pre-paid purchase code, this option will have your belt shipped to you. It will come pre-configured with the purchaser as
    your owner. (This owner must authorize any change in ownership.) 
    <br/><br/>
    <li>Marketplace Purchase (as Wearer)</li>
    <i>(This is a great option if you want an owner, but don't have one, or if you want a belt and can't afford one.)</i><br/>
    You can select the ownership term length you are agree to, and any limits on belt settings, and you will be listed on our sponsored purchase directory for
    prospective owners. As soon as one selects you and makes payment, your belt will be shipped to you with your new owner pre-configured. For fastest selection,
    we recommend setting term length as long as you are comfortable with and setting as few settings limits as you are comfortable with.
    (At the the end of the agreed term, you will be given a one-time option to unlock and clear the owner, or to keep them as your owner)
    <br/><br/>
    <li>Earn-your-release Plan (formerly: Payment Plans and Work-to-own Arrangements)</li>
    <i>(This is a great option if you want to be locked right away, but can't afford a belt right now.)</i><br/>
    Now <i>Payment Plans</i> and <i>Work-to-own arrangements</i> have been combined into our Earn-your-release Plan. You will get your belt right away and lock it,
    and be able to make payments or earn payment credits, and when your belt is fully paid for, then you can unlock your belt.
    <ul>
      <li>Encouragement</li>
      While orgasms will be disabled (except for rewards specified below, and possible special offers), teasing and edging will be automatically used by your
      belt to keep you entertained and aroused, and encourage you to make progress on your plan.
      <br/><br/>

      <li>Payment Plan</li>
      Make payments towards your belt's purchase price at any time. These can be made via credit card, payroll deduction, or app.
      <br/><br/>

      <li>Work-to-own Arrangement</li>
      Work in one of our "public use" facilities to earn payment credits towards your belt's purchase price. Your belt will also offer you extra encouragement
      while you are working to earn your release. Some locations may also offer temporary unlocking (while restrained) for full-use.<br/>
      <i>(Amount credited varies based on local demand, wearer's age/gender/etc., act(s) performed, and other factors. Please select a facility in your
      area for example credit amounts.)</i>
      <br/><br/>

      <li>Referral Credits</li>
      Any belts purchased (by either owner or wearer) using one of your referral links or codes will earn you a credit of 5% of the amount paid.<br/>
      <i>(If the referred belt is also part of an earn-your-release plan, your credits will be applied as the referred wearer makes their payments/credits.)</i>
      <br/><br/>

      <li>Rewards for progress</li>
      At designated points along your payment progress, reward orgasms may be offered. A fee of 1% of your purchase price will be charged against your account balance
      if accepted. There is no charge if declined. You may also opt-out of these rewards at time of ordering to avoid future temptation, if desired.
      <br/><br/>

      <li>Breeding Plan</li>
      If you are aged 18-29, female, not on birth control, and otherwise medically able, you can also earn your release through our breeding program.
      You can choose this at time of purchase, or at any point during your earn-your-release plan. One month locked in the belt, with no unlocking, is required prior to
      the first breeding attempt to ensure no pre-existing pregnancy. You may opt for a surrogacy with implantation occuring at one of our breeding facilities. You may
      also opt for traditional breeding while restrained at one of our breeding facilities, with insemination either done artificially or naturally. Your belt's
      full cost will be paid for by the prospective parent(s), along with any medical costs, and a weekly food and maternity clothes stipend. Any payments/credits
      you have made towards your earn-your-release plan will be refunded to you after the baby is born.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Note</b>: Our belts can detect pregnancy, provide adjust to your changing body shape, provide emergency unlocking for medical personal, and automatically
      unlock in the event of a unplanned delivery. Please consult the user guide's section on Pregnancy if you have any questions or concerns.
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <li>Other options</li>
    Also see our charitable options to see if you qualify for any of our special programs.
  </ul>
  <b>Note</b>: For all wearer purchase options except full self-payment, locking is required within 7 days of receipt of belt. Failure to lock belt on to designated
  wearer within this time period, may result in full payment being charged to your credit card or legal action to recover full cost of the belt.

    <li>Pyramid Foundation</li>

    Please check with your employer or prospective employer for more details. You can also check our corporate client list for some of the employers providing
    belts, but this list is not exaustive as not all organizations wish to broadly publicize their belt programs.<br/>

    <li>SPH Foundation</li>
    The SPH Foundation encourages male chasity among certain men in an effort to increase average penis size over time by removing poorly-endowed men from the
    breeding population, and also to reduce partner disappointment in the short term by locking away penises likely to disappoint.<br/>
    If your penis length, girth, and/or volume is at or below the 25th percentile for your country, you may qualify for a free belt.<br/>
    Note: SPH Foundation provided belts generally require permanent locking (***). Oral sex (providing) and anal sex (receiving) and strap-on-assisted sex

      <li>Pleasure and tease you</li>
      <li>Edge you</li>
      <li>Give you an orgasm (or force you to have many)</li>
      <li>Administer punishment shocks</li>
    </ul>
    Note: inidividual features cannot be disabled, but cam account owner can adjust required tip levels as desired.<br/>
    We'll link to your account on our directory of locked cam-girls (or guys), sending tons of chastity-interested users to your channel, ready to donate. And we'll
    also set you up with an an affiliate link, and you'll receive a commission for any belts purchased via your link.<br/>
    <br/>
    Is your channel just starting out, or you just don't want the up-front cost of a belt? Our Cam-girl program can also be paired with our one of our
    [["Earn-your-release" Plans|BeltPurchaseWearer]] and 50% of your tips will go to you and 50% will go to paying down your plan balance. Feature tip costs are set by us
    while on Earn-your-release plan, but no additional fee is required for tip-provided orgasms. Any "Extend your lock time" extentions start from time of plan completion.

    <li>Simp Collector Program (Locked or Unlocked)</li>
    Do you have, or want, a following of devoted simps? They'll keep coming back to your account when their chastity device is linked to your stream. They'll
    get teased whenever they are online and a "hype train" happens! In addition to their tips, they can also contribute additional lock time to keep the train going.
    They'll be brought to the edge as it gets to a higher level, and if it the train reaches max level, all that participated in the train get an orgasm! You can
    disable this orgasm, set it to tip-contributions-only, or set it to only go to a percentage of participants, if desired. (Or if you are locked, you can set it to
    go to just you, instead of your simps.)
    <br/><br/>
    You get a commission for each chastity device a simp buys from your channel's link, plus all the tips on your channel are always yours. (Or are split with you if
    you are on an "Earn-your-release" Plan.)
    <br/><br/>
    Note: If you prefer one-on-one interaction with your simps instead, you can contact our Findom Coordinator for information on other programs that may interest you.

    <li>Influencer (Locked)</li>
    Do you have a large, existing social-media presence? Contact us if you are interested in being financially rewarded for wearing one of our belts and discussing it on
    your platform. Don't worry, we'll ensure your horniness and maybe eventual desperation is real, so you won't need to lie to your viewers. As far as non-financial
    rewards - we can discuss what belt settings will best suit your audience. Compensation will vary based on your audience size, and demographics.<br/><br/>
    Note: Any "lock periods" agreed to require actual locking of the belt and cannot be terminated early, ensure you schedule any other engagements that require you to
    be unbelted around your belted-period if needed.
    <br/><br/>
    <li>Referrals (Locked or Unlocked)</li>

      select centers).
      <ul>
        <li>VIP Upgrade</li>
        Upgrade your membership to the VIP level and you can pick your favorite belted wearer to service you when you visit. While we can't officially guarantee they'll
        be there for your scheduled visit, the targeted teasing and special offers our belt will give them, will all but ensure it.
        <li>Contract Buyout Option</li>
        Decide you want to keep her (or him)? You'll also have the option to buy out their plan. If they agree, you can take them home with full control of their belt.
        Keep them to yourself, or share them if you prefer. Unlock them as frequently, or as rarely, as you like.
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br/><br/>
    <li>Breeding Program</li>
    Are you a single parent or couple wanting a child but don't want to or can't carry one yourself? One of our belted girls would love to help!
    She'll be locked and secure for at least a month prior to conception, to ensure the baby's parentage. After you decide the type of breeding you are looking for,
    just select the mother you want to breed, and we can start making the arrangements.
    <ul>
      <li>Volunteer Donor (Optional, included)</li>
      Regardless of which type of parent you are, if you don't have a biological father chosen, you can select one from our many volunteers at no additional charge.
      Our volunteers always prefer natural insemination, you can also choose to be present for the conception if you like.      
      <br/><br/>
      <li>Surrogacy (Additional Cost)</li>
      If you already have both parents decided, and need someone to carry the baby, our surrogacy option will work for you. Additional charges apply for IVF costs.
      <br/><br/>
      <li>Natural insemination (Standard)</li>
      For non-surrogacy breedings, natural insemination is preferred. Your chosen mother will be restrained and unbelted and available for you or your chosen father
      to inseminate her. Studies are unclear as to whether her orgasm will aid in conception or not, so that is entirely up to you.
      <br/><br/>
      <li>Artificial insemination (Additional cost)</li>
      If you will be providing the father, artificial insemination is also available at an additional cost. A vibrator-induced orgasm can also be optionally provided
      after insemination if you request it at no added cost.
      <br/><br/>
      <li>Single father</li>
      Most of our single fathers opt for the natural process, but the other options are also available to you.
      <li>Gay couple</li>
      Most of our gay couples choose the artificial process. However if one or both of you are bi, the "nautral" process is also available.
      If you haven't already decided which of you will be the biological father, you can both attempt to breed her, and let nature decide which one conceives.
      Alternatively, if selecting an artificial insemination, you can both provide samples. We will mix them and inseminate her with both.
      <br/><br/>
      <li>Single mother / Lesbian couple</li>
      In addition to our standard options, we also have the option of a simulated "natural" process. Your chosen father will provide a sample, that will be placed in
      our special strap-on. You can then simulate breeding your chosen mother. When you decide it's time, just trigger the dildo and it will release the sample into her.
      <br/><br/>
      <li>Straight couple</li>
      Frequently our straight couples choose the surrogacy option, but the other options described above are also available.
