  You and Andrew had originally picked a date in early June, but had soon discovered that picking that date meant many of your friends from school wouldn't be able
  to attend.  Looking for a date when your school friends, and your family, and Andrew's family can all make it, and the church is available, was a challenge.  But
  you were able to find one - the Saturday after finals.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Standing around in the coffee shop all day was getting difficult,
  <<if $JobBikiniBarista>>
    <<set $JobBikiniBaristaFormer>>
    and you'd started to feel ridiculous in your bikini,
  <</if>>
  so you'd gone on maternity leave.  But after you and Andrew talked about it more, you decided to let them know you wouldn't be coming back after the baby.
  Why spend all that time away from your baby
  when Andrew makes more than enough.

  With the wedding preparations going on, you barely study for your finals at all and don't do very well.  You still manage to pass all of your classes, except one.
  You get some sort of notice from the university the day after your exam
  <<if $AcademicProbation>>
    <<set $AcademicHold to 1>>
    telling you that you haven't been making satisfactory academic progress.  It says that you have to meet with the dean's office immediately or you won't be

    you had wanted.  He's definitely agreeing with you stop, at least for now, after this one.

    You and him discuss the wedding date, and check the availability for the venue you both want.  You realize that the by the date you settle on, you'll be

  him again until the church.  "I thought it was bad luck for me to see you at all today before then," he jokes.

  you realize that's not why he's under there at all.  You don't argue but just lay back and enjoy it.  Eventually you
  move your dress out of the way so you can look into his eyes whenever he looks up at you.  When your own eyes
  aren't rolling back that is.

  After he's given you two orgasms, you feel it's time to take care of him.  His cock was already struggling to stay

  the first time as husband and wife.

  It's wonderful having Andrew off work, and all to yourself for a few days.  You surprise him with a few special honeymoon outfits you'd purchases.  You were thrilled

  Walking too much isn't comfortable for you, so the two of you spend more time in the hotel room than you probably would on a normal vacation.

  Andrew wasn't sure at first when you had told him you planned on delivering nude, but you reassured him that it was a common thing to do.  After you told him about
  the benefits of skin-to-skin contact with the baby, and about how the gowns wouldn't be covering much anyway most of the time, he was less nervous about it.  Of
  course you plan on putting one of the gowns on afterwards, before family starts coming to see you and the baby.

  The labor goes on for hours.  You'd wanted to "experience the natural joy of childbirth", you had told yourself beforehand, but now as the contractions get more
  intense, you start to question that.  "Why the hell couldn't X-Change invent a 'painless childbirth' option!", you ask outloud.  "Forget natural!", you tell the
  nurse, "I want an epideral!"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  A couple minutes later the doctor is telling you "There's no time for an epideral now.  I'm going to need you to Push..."

  <h1>Recovering</h1>
  The first few couple weeks after you get home, is spent focusing on diaper changes, middle-of-the-night feedings, and letting your body recover from what it just
  went through, so your doctor's instructions to wait at least six weeks before having sex again seemed reasonable.
  <<set setup.addSex({sex: 'male', name: 'Andrew'})>>

<<nobr>>
  But then you feel your libido start to come back, slowly at first.  But then you are watching Andrew rock the baby to sleep, seeing what a great father he is
  and will be, and you suddenly want Andrew more than you ever had before.  You don't want to wait any longer.
<</nobr>>

  <img src="PartX/AndrewFamily7.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="640" align="left">
<<nobr>>
  After they baby is asleep you tell Andrew you want him inside you, but he reminds you of what the doctor had said.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectAnal>>
    You tell Andrew to fuck your ass instead, but the doctor had said that had to wait too.
  <</if>>
  "Ok, no sex," you say reluctantly.  "Would a blowjob be ok?" you add.  Andrew doesn't have any objections at all to that.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Once you've finished with Andrew, you tell him "The doctor said I was ok to masturbate whenever I felt up to it, as long as it was external 
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectMasturbationBlock>>
    only.  Except I can't even do that."
  <<else>>
    only."
  <</if>>
  You reach into your drawer and pull out your vibrator and add, "Maybe you could help out.  Just hold it on my clit like this."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It isn't long until you are covering your mouth with your hand so your moans don't wake the baby.  Still, [[six weeks|AndrewSixWeeks]] is not going to
  come soon enough.

  Happily it doesn't take long before you are pregnant again.  You know much more what to expect during your pregnancy this time around, but you also have
  <<print $children[0].name>> to take care of too, which starts to be a challenge as you get further and further along.  But Andrew takes the last month of your

  This time you opt for the epideral as soon as you can.  It helps, but you still find yourself screaming about why they haven't they cured this yet.  But like before,
  once little <<print $children[1].name>> is in your arms, you don't care anymore.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Of course, afterwards the doctor gives the same instructions about waiting six weeks.  It's a little easier to wait this time, at least at first, if only because the

  Sex isn't quite as frequent for you and Andrew as it was before, so it takes a bit longer before you are pregnant with your third.  But when you head to your

  you are a school teacher and it's parent-teacher conference day.  The handsome, single dad of one of your students
  is meeting with you today to discuss the poor grade his child received.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He shows how much he really cares about his child's education as he drops down to his knees under your desk.  You
  never wear panties on conference day just in case of times like this.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He's given you one orgasm, and is well on the way to giving you a second, when you can't wait any longer.  You stand up
  and then bend over your desk.  "Fuck me!" you instruct him.  A moment later his pants are down and he's inside you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He leaves your classroom a while later with a smile on his face, and his child's updated report card in his hand.
  You cross your legs to hide the evidence leaking out between them as the next parent walks in.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  As you look up at him you make a mental note to yourself, next time schedule the single dads with more time between each
  one, so you have a chance to clean up between them.  For this time though, you'll just have to be extra generous with the

  you are working at a fertility clinic.  You are in charge of helping the sperm donors provide their donations.
  Your clinic prides itself on being 'full-service'.  Here you don't just drop the guys in a room with some
  porn and a cup.  Here you let them lie down and relax, while you 'extract' the sample for them.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>

  Before they added the 'milking table' the donors would just lie down on their backs on a normal medical table
  while you took care of them.  But a few times you'd found some of the donors too hot to resist, and had climbed up
  on top of them.  After you'd rode them until you took their 'sample' for yourself, they were unable to provide the
  one they'd be brought in to give.  At least for a while.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Now their cocks hang down below the table, making it easy to [[extract their sample|AndrewDaydreamHealth2]] into a cup,
  but hard to enjoy their cocks for yourself.  Though not impossible, as you imagine what position would work the best.

  <h1>Assisting with their donation</h1>
  But you've discovered that if you don't keep going when your donors get close to cumming, but stop just before they
  orgasm, they won't have a real orgasm, but a ruined one.  Some of their cum will ooze out, just enough to give you
  a taste, just a bit to feel it drip down your chest.

  They'll want to reach down and finish themselves off with their hand.  But you strapped them into the milking table
  so they "wouldn't fall off", so they are powerless to move.  With the little dribbled, ruined orgasm, they are
  ready to go again right away.  This time they beg you to let them cum for real.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You usally don't the second time.  You can get three our four ruined onces out of them before they start to
  thrash on the table with their growing need.  That's usually when you get the cup ready and make sure
  to give them a proper orgasm this time.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  As they grown and cum harder than they probably ever have before, the squirt more and more cum into the cup for you.
  They may have been threatening to complain to your supervisor a few minutes ago, but when they finally stagger
  out of your extraction room, any thoughts of complaints are long gone.

  You hear the professor say your name and your attention quickly returns to the class.  You try to ignore your wet panties

  But you push those thoughts out of your mind.  Even if they did, it was before you and Andrew met.  And he hasn't

  She seems completely professional though as a tutor, and she does help you a great deal, and you pass all your

    "Of course. A supply of condoms can be found in each guest room, many public areas, or by request from any of our staff.

  You want to be a good wife, and a good submissive, so seeing the luggage that was delivered to the room, you decide to
  unpack everything while he sleeps.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You place all of Andrew's clothes, you place them in the closet or dresser.  From
  your bags, you just pull out your toiletries and place them by the sink.  You leave most of your clothes packed,
  taking out only a few things you think Andrew might want you to wear at some point.  The rest you leave in the suitcase
  which you store in the closet.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you are done you are feeling a bit tired too, and decide to take a nap also. Neither you or Andrew wake up 
  [[until the next morning|AndrewNoKidsVacation7]].

  You wake up and take a shower while Andrew is still sleeping.  When you come out of your shower, you kneel on the floor next
  to him.  You can see he either woke up with an erection, or got hard seeing you come back from the shower, naked.  You decide
  to think that it was all from you.  As soon as he jestures towards it, you quickly get to work sucking his cock.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Good girl.  I have something nice for you today.  I've made an appointment for you to reward you for being such a good girl
  yesterday. "I want you to do whatever they tell you at your appointment."  You respond with a 'Yes, sir' as you wonder what
  they might tell you to do.  It's just a few minutes after that when someone comes to take you to your appointment.  They
  clip a leash to your collar and lead you over to the resort's spa, then into to the massage area of the spa.
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <img src="Part14/Island7.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="600">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You are early, so you patiently wait until your appointment time.  Once it arrives a woman comes and leads you from the
  waiting area into the massage room. After making sure you are comfortably positioned on the massage table, she binds your
  hands and feet to the table. "We don't want any subs getting over excited and falling off and injuring themselves, do we?"
  she says.  "Or, getting impatient and taking matters into your own hands."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  She glances down at her tablet as she looks you over.  "Your master wants to reward you," she says. "Have you been a good
  girl?  I bet you have," she adds as she pats your bottom.  She then sets her tablet down on a nearby table.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Her skilled hands roam over your body, rubbing warm oil into your arms, shoulders, back and legs.  You ache for more, and
  she knows it. But she keeps you wanting it, at least for a while longer.  When her hand finally moves from down from your
  back, and between your cheeks to tease your ass you moan into the towels she'd laid down for you.  She pours the warm oil
  between your cheeks, her well-oiled finger then begins slowly pushing it's way into your ass.  Meanwhile her other hand
  begins sliding between your lips before sliding into you from beneath.
  <br><br>
  She could probably have you cumming in a minute or two if she wanted, but she doesnt.  She takes it slow, keeping you close
  to an orgasm, but not giving you one.  Whenever you are getting too close, her hands move back to working your muscles, only
  returning to pleasure you when you've cooled down a bit.
  <br><br>
  You can feel your orgasm building again.  You want to cry when she pulls out again.  But this time is different.  She pours
  more warm oil, and then slides two slick fingers into your ass.  With her other hand, her fingers slide across your clit a
  few times, before she begins fucking you with two, then three fingers.  Before you know it, you are screaming out an orgasm.
  You tug at your restraints as you feel yourself orgasm and clench down on her still thrusting fingers.
  <br><br>
  Finally, after your orgasm has started to fade, she pulls out of you.  She pats your ass and tells you, "You can lie there
  and relax for a moment if you need to.  Whenever you feel up to it, you can hop in the shower over there and then head down
  to the pool to meet up with your master."  She jestures over to a nearby door, which you assume leads to a shower.  "If
  you need me to call for an escort, let me know, otherwise you should be able to find your way."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Thank you ma'am," you tell her.  "That was amazing.  I should be fine on my own."  You then head to the shower to clean
  up before [[heading down to the pool|AndrewNoKidsVacation8]] to meet with Andrew.

  You thank her and head out to the hall to find your way to the pool.

<</nobr>>

    You can't believe it, you are finally getting to have sex with Andrew, in public, just like you'd fantasized about.

    It is just as amazing as you'd always imagined it would be.  Your only disappointment is that only a few people

    Andrew lovingly strokes your ass cheek for a moment and says, "Thank you so much for being willing to do this.

  After Andrew introduces you to Becca, she explains that she's a 'free-use' slave for the rest of the summer, "owned"
  by the resort until the end of the season.  "I get to stay at the resort for free, in exchange for making myself
  available for any guests that want to use me."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When she sees that you worried you are taking advantage of her she tries to reassure you.  "Oh, I love it.  That's
  why I came here, to give up control.  I get to have an entire summer at this beautiful resort, and all I had pay for
  is my plane ticket.  I love not being able to say no, to whatever guest wants to use me.  But when it's a couple as
  young and hot as you two, that's even better."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  She's convinced you.  But you realize you've been so concerned about her, you hadn't stopped to wonder exactly
  what you husband planned to [[use this pretty young woman for|AndrewNoKidsVacation12]].
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <h1>A threesome with Becca and Andrew</h1>
  Andrew's plans for Becca are just what you expected, he's wanting a threesome with you and her.  You know it's a

  Andrew starts by having Becca eat you out.  Watching that, it doesn't take him long before he's hard and horny.
  You watch as he puts on a condom, lubes it up, and slowly slides it into Becca's ass.  As she looks up at you, and
  you see the pleasure in your eyes, you know she's loving it.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectAnal>>
    You know that feeling well.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You and Andrew both comes before he finishes.  You were too caught up in your own pleasure to see whether or not
  Becca did as well.  But if she didn't her pleasure will have to wait.  Andrew says he has
  [[dinner reservations|AndrewNoKidsVacation13]] for the three of you.

  After you and Becca take turns making sure you are each clean, you take some time to give Becca the orgasm she'd
  missed out on earlier.
<</nobr>>

  After your shower, you and Becca get ready, and then head back into the rest of the room to rejoin Andrew.

    Of course, you wouldn't expect anything else.  And you love it.

    know you and Becca certainly won't be the only ones naked.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The three of you have a lovely meal and you both get to know Becca more.  She tells you about a competition she
  was in a "hunt" of some sort, but where she was the prey being chased.  She tells you how much fun it was getting
  caught, and how the "hunters" used her when they did catch her.  "I didn't come close to winning, but it was the most
  fun I've ever had.  You should try it if you are here long enough."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You smile but know that it sounds like way too much for you, especially since you don't want to be with any other man

  Back in your room, Becca and you start eating each other out.  Andrew takes turn fucking each of you while you

  you he fills. Becca eagerly licks up every drop she can as she continues to eat you out.  Watching the two of you
  continue to pleasure each other, soon has Andrew ready to go again.

  Becca is yours and Andrew's for the rest of your stay, and the three of you have a lot of fun, both in your room,
  as well as enjoying the more traditional resort facilities, and a few non-traditional ones as well.  But eventually
  it's time to leave.
<</nobr>>

  You say goodbye to Becca and tell her that you hope she has a wonderful time at the resort the rest of the summer.

  before.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Of course, he doesn't ask you to wear a collar 24/7 like some some of the submissives you met on your trip do.
  That would be embarassing for you, and cause a lot of questions for him whenever you join him at work events, or
  meet with his parents.  But when it's just you and him at home, you are very frequently wearing one.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  And when it's just you and him, and he orders you to strip, drop to your knees, and suck his cock, you always
  happily obey.

  You are enjoying school much more this year now that it's all upper level classes in a subject you enjoy.

    He

  After a week or two, you are usually begging him to let you suck his cock, just to feel and taste his orgasm,
  while you still ache for your own.

  Some of the subs in chastity at the resort said they hadn't came in months, a few in years.  You can't imagine

  It's not always about Andrew's pleasure.  And it's not always with him being dominant and you being submissive, or
  at least not in the same way.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Usually after a few weeks, Andrew lets you cum.  Sometimes it's with his head between your legs, making you scream
  as you wrap your legs around his head.  But more often, it's with him on top of you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  There's nothing more amazing that feeling your husband inside you, while his body is over you, holding your legs
  pinned to your chest.  You love it even more when he holds your wrists down with his hands as he makes you orgasm,
  and then cums too, with your hands still held down by his.

  But since Andrew's salary is already more than enough for you both, you have the freedom to choose based on
  other criteria.  So instead you went with a small startup focusing on rooftop gardens and hydroponics.

  They are hoping to change the world by reducing the need to clear forests for farmland, by allowing many city

  You have no trouble finding a job with your Business degree.  Andrew gets you one working for his father's
  company.  Your only disappointment is when you show up on your first day and find out you won't be working
  for Andrew.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  That was the original plan, but the HR person said that you couldn't report directly to your husband.  So
  instead you have a different boss.  You don't really see the point of the rule, since your father-in-law is
  still the owner, and eventually Andrew will be.  But you both accept it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "So, I guess my plan to 'help you relax' before meetings is out the window now," you joke with Andrew over

  You'd fantasized about doing something like this every day.  You'd imagined sucking your husband/boss's cock before his
  a big meeting, and then sitting across the table with him at the meeting, with the taste of his cum still on your tongue.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But now that sort of fun is only an occasional bit of fun when you and him are in the office on a weekend, and no
  one else is around.  There's no big meeting to go to afterwards, just a bit of work to catch up on.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Most of your fun together is always [[going to be at home|AndrewNoKidsHome5]].  Perhaps that's for the best though.
  You wonder if Andrew would actually be able to concentrate on work, if you were doing this every day.

  Earlier on you'd considered whether you wanted to take the LSAT and apply to law school.  But you decide you didn't
  want three more years of school, or to become a lawyer.  Being a police officer didn't appeal to you, plus Andrew
  was worried it was too dangerous.  What you settled on was becomming a probation officer.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You feel like you can help people get their life on track and avoid reoffending and ending up in prison, or help
  them restart their lives after they get out of prison.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you heard that they were setting up a special office to deal with offenses related to X-Change, you were excited.
  There's been a huge increase in certain low-level offenses, with the offenders being users of X-Change.  Knowing the
  struggles and desires a newly changed body can give you, you felt you were especially well suited to be a PO in the new
  office.  The supervisor agreed.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Probably 90% of the cases you deal with are for one of three crimes.  There's the public indecencies, those offenders
  are usually trying X-Change for the first time, and get carried away after they take it.  Then they get caught
  having sex, or just running around naked, in public.  Usually a lecture or two, and regular monitoring is enough
  to get them on the right track.  They tend to act much better the next time they are on X-Change.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="PartX/CCJ2.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="500" align="right">
  <img src="PartX/CCJ1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="500" align="left">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  Then there's the shoplifters. There are two types of those.  The ones trying to steal X-Change.  And the ones who are
  already on X-Change and are just shoplifting because they think they can get away with it.  They think now that they
  are attractive women, if they are caught they'll just be able to flirt, or perhaps more, with security and be let go.
  Maybe that happens sometimes, but certainly not with the ones that ended up in your office.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The ones that were just doing it for the thrill have usually learned their lesson and probably won't try it again.
  The first group however, are more of a concern for repeat offending.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  And the final group you have to deal with are the ones convicted of prostitution.  Some are doing it just to earn some
  extra money, but most are doing it because they can't afford their next X-Change pill, and so they do what they can
  to make the money for it.  Often they'll have a pimp that keeps them supplied with X-Change, as long as they keep working
  the street for him.  These are the ones that [[most need your help|AndrewNoKidsCCJJob2]].
<</nobr>>

::AndrewNoKidsCCJJob2
<<nobr>>
  <h1>Getting them off the street</h1>
  For the offenders you see, that are so desperate to change to be a woman, or to remain changed, you wish you
  could just give them a Plus pill and let them be who they want to be.  But Plus pills are expensive, and your office
  doesn't have the budget.  Besides, if you started doing that, people would be offending on purpose, just to get a
  free pill.
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <img src="PartX/CCJ4.gif" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400" align="left">
  What you can offer them though is a discounted Plus pill, on a payment plan.  The X-Change corporation has generally
  offered to let you distribute Plus pills to those you think are in need of them.  They only ask for half payment, and
  even then only within 36 months, with no interest.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  They are still being punished for their crimes, and you need to make sure they do make their payments, so you are
  required by your department to fit them with chastity belts.  In addition to serving as a deterent for anyone offending
  just to get a pill, this has the added benefit of making their ability engage in prostitution much more limited.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Your department has a contingency fund set asside if there are ever any offenders that don't make their payments, but
  your boss said they haven't had to use it, even once yet.  Nearly all of the offenders pay off their pill early.  He
  suspects it's because they can't have their belt removed until both their probation is over AND they've paid for their
  pill in full.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="PartX/CCJ5.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="600" align="right">
  He's probably right.  You imagine they must be eager to be out of their belts as soon as possible.  That's why you
  are more flexible about their job placements than you would be with a more traditional probation.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Normally, you wouldn't be allowed to place someone at someplace like a strip club.  But you are allowed to place your
  charges there if they are interested.  Most are.  They likely enjoy the pay they receive there, since it lets them
  pay off their belt early.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  They probably also enjoy their 'work-release' form their belts.  Given the nature of their jobs, your department allows
  the club owner to have a copy of their key on the condition that can only have it off while they are at the club and
  working.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Special care has to be taken though to ensure they don't reoffend.  Technically offering "extras" at the strip club,
  blow jobs or sex for example, is a form of prostitution.  You make sure they are aware that getting caught engaging
  in that will likely mean spending the rest of their probation in jail instead.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  They seemed to have taken your warnings to heart though, because some of your male colleagues frequently do undercover
  checks on your charges, to make sure they don't engage in that sort of thing and have yet to report anyone back as
  being in violation.  You appreciate that the guys are willing to do that on their own time, outside of work.  They
  told you not to worry about it, it's their pleasure and they are happy to help.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You stick a bit closer to your official hours though.  As much as you enjoy helping these young women get their lives
  on the right track, you want to make sure you don't focus too much on your job and still

  You and Andrew will usually take the opporunity to go out for a romantic evening together, followed by a passionate evening at home.  Though sometimes you like to
  spice it up a bit more.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You wonder what Andrew will do when he gets home from work.  Will dinner plans wait a bit while he ravages his helpless wife?  Or will he grab the keys to the
  cuffs from the top shelf and unlock you, saving the rest of the fun for later.  You wonder if telling him how wet you are aleady will make him want to use you now,
  or more eager make you wait for it.  Then you realize that he could use you <i>and</i> leave you horny and aching for when you get home.  You put a pillow from the
  sofa on the floor and kneel on it.  Hopefully seeing you waiting for him like that will give him the same idea you just had.
<</nobr>>

  $children[0].name is almost three now.  You and Andrew had talked about having another, but decided against it.  You'd rather focus just on $children[0].name.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  With just one child, you and Andrew can make sure
  <<if $children[0].sex == 'male'>>
    he
  <<else>>
    she
  <</if>>
  always has the best.  With just one to pay for you could easily afford the best preschool, which
  <<if $children[0].sex == 'male'>>
    he'll
  <<else>>
    she'll
  <</if>>
  be starting in next year.  You want
  <<if $children[0].sex == 'male'>>
    him
  <<else>>
    her
  <</if>>
  to be ready when she starts kindergarten, and the private school you already have

    him

    her
  <</if>>
  pre-enrolled for.
<</nobr>>

  And with just one child to manage, bringing $children[0].name along on a trip to the farmer's market is no problem at all.  Nothing makes you happier than
  when you look back and Andrew pushing $children[0].name's stroller, and thinking about what a great father Andrew is.
<</nobr>>

    teaching $children[0].name how to drive a car.

    walking $children[0].name down the aisle at her own wedding.

  You wish $children[0].name could stay this age forever.  But you know you'll be happy to watch
  <<if $children[0].sex == 'male'>>
    him

  <</if>>
  grow up.  And who knows, maybe you and Andrew will think about having another baby when $children[0].name is almost grown.

<<nobr>>
  With three, soon to be four, kids running around, it's rarely quiet at home.  But in a rare peaceful moment, you stop to think about when you'd first
  received that letter from the school.  That was six years ago.  It's seems a bit strange now to think that you've only been a woman for six years.  It seems
  even stranger when you realize that more than half your time as a woman, you've spent pregnant.  You wonder how long you can keep that trend going.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you were first planning on getting married, you and Andrew had talked about having five kids.  You'd both wanted a large family, and that'd seemed like a
  lot back then.  Now, it doesn't seem like that many.  Maybe you and Andrew should have a talk to see if maybe a few more would be better.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Maybe it's better to not decide on a number, the two of you can just keep going, and decide to stop whenever the two of you think it's enough.
