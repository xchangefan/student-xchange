    <h1>Changing Majors</h1>
    You've decided to change majors.  Hopefully changing now won't delay your graduation any.

    <h1>Choosing a Major</h1>
    It's your sophomore year now, and while you've definitely thought about it before now, it's time to finalize your choice of a major.
    Of course you could always change it later, but that would probably mean graduating later and you don't want that.

    Of course you once you are married, you expect Andrew will be making enough that you wouldn't even need to work outside
    the home.  But you might still want to, so you should pick a major still.  But it's probably safe to pick something you enjoy,
    and not really worry about how much it pays.
  <<elseif $Engaged>>
    Once you and $Engaged are married, you'll both be brining money in, so you are probably safe picking something you know you'll
    enjoy, and not worrying as much about how much it pays.

    <br><br>
    Health Sciences -
    <<if $PlayerLazyStudent>>
      Some people think it's a blow-off degree, but you've seen the course requirements.  It's not as bad as Nursing,
      but you'd be spending all your time studying anatomy and what-not, and not be able to spend enough time with Andrew.
      At at then, for what, to be a personal trainer or something?
    <<else>>
      If you are going to spend years studying anatomy and everything else, you'd rather go all the way and
      get a nursing degree instead.
    <</if>>

  <<if !$EngineeringShutdown>>
    Math/Computer Science/Engineering - You aren't interested in being a Computer, Math, or Engineering major.
    <<if !$PlayerGoodStudent>>That sounds way too hard<</if>>
  <</if>>
  <<if $PlayerLazyStudent>>
    <br><br>
    Nursing - You'd looked into the classes they have to take.  While it's not as bad as for doctors, or as long, but you know you aren't the best student.
    You rather enjoy your remaining time at the university, rather than be over your head and fail out.
  <</if>>
  <br><br>
  Philosophy - You feel like you'd never get a job with this major.
  <br><br>
  Pre-law or Pre-med -
      <<if $PlayerGoodStudent>>
        You aren't sure if you could handle law or medical school, and you are positive you don't want to be in school that long.
      <<else>>
        You doubt you'd even be able to get into law or medical school after graduation, let alone pass.
      <</if>>
  <br><br>
  Science - You've quickly learned science at university is much harder than it was in high school.  You don't know what you'd do with a
      Biology, Chemistry, or Physics degree unless you went on to get a Doctorate,
      <<if $PlayerGoodStudent>>
        and you aren't wanting to be in school that long.
      <<else>>
        and there's not much chance of that happening
      <</if>>

  Women's studies - You aren't sure of the job market.  And whether it's true or not, you feel like you'd be at a disadvantage over the
  natural-born women studying this.

<<nobr>>
  Your college friends joked a bit when they found out you were planning on majoring in Agricultural Studies.  "You don't need to go to
  college to be a farmer!" they said and laughed.  They are all from big cities, and are probably thinking of farming like it was when your
  grandfather or great-grandfather started farming.  But things have changed a lot since then.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $Spouse == "Andrew">>
    Before you met Andrew, you had thought about working on your grandfathers farm.  All the technology in farming now is
    a bit overwhelming for him.  And he's looking to retire soon.  But that's no really in the cards anymore.  Andrew's
    job is in the city, not on a small town farm.
    <br><br>
    Still, you can spend some time helping your grandfather bring his farm into the 21st century.  And then maybe help
    him find someone to take over the day-to-day operations of the farm.  Either that or see if he wants to either sell
    the farm or look to pass it on to one of his other grandchildren.
    <br><br>
    While working on his farm is off the table for you, there are certainly ag jobs in the city.  The Big Ag companies sometimes
    get a bad reputation, but they're always hiring and pay well.  Plus there's plenty of small startups in that space too, and
    you wouldn't really be worried about them going under as much since you don't really need the money.    
    <br><br>
    You can worry about where you'll work later.  But you've always imagined a job where you'd be helping to feed the world,
    and that's exactly what you plan on doing after you graduate.
  <<else>>
    Your grandfather has struggled to keep up with all the technology in farming now.  He's avoided using drones or satellites to map his fields
    like you've talked to him about, even though you know he could use the information to choose what to plant where, and to make him more
    money.  He certainly wasn't happy when he replaced his aging combine and his new one was "more computer than tractor".
    <br><br>
    You know your grandfather has been wanting to retire for a while.  He had originally planned on passing the farm down to your dad, but
    your dad had ended up with an office job, and no interest in farming.  When you were growing up, and much more interested in farming, he
    had been excited.  You and him had talked about maybe helping him out on the farm after college, and then taking over once you were ready.
    <br><br>
    Of course, that all had been before your change.  You wonder if he's going to feel the same about his granddaughter taking over as he
    did about his grandson.  Luckily he's more open minded than your mom's dad, so it'll probably be ok.
    <br><br>
    Your are glad that you are mostly done with your general classes.  You are sure you'll do much better now that your classes are in thing
    you are actually interested in, and that you know you'll be using.

    So having a few friends on the inside might get you a foot in the door to talk to the right people when that time comes.

    Of course you know how to make someone feel good on your massage table.  But learning about how the body works, and
    how to actually help them heal from your touch would be even better.
    <br><br>
    Of course, having training and being qualified to have your own legitimate massage business would make it much easier
    to also have your more fun and profitable massage business right along side it.
    <br><br>
    Or maybe, you'll bore of giving happy endings and want to focus on

      working as a personal trainer.

    You enjoy teaching yoga, clothed or not.  Learning about how the body works, and how to better help people improve their
    health and wellness would be even better.
    <br><br>
    With proper training you'll be able to get a job anywhere.  But if you decide to go out on your own and start your own studio, then
    your 'Private Session' will probably be as popular as they are at school.  Even if you want to keep it legal, there's nothing
    against the law about having fully nude yoga classes as long as you make sure your students are all adults.
  <<elseif $BodyType == 'Fit'>>
    Your body helps you stay fit, but you know it's not as easy for others.  Learning more about nutrition, exercise, and how the body
    works could help you later if you want to be a personal trainer.
    <br><br>
    Your clients won't know how easy it comes to you, so your fit, toned body will be a walking advertisement for your skills as a trainer.
    And from what you know about guys, and excellent motivator for them as well.
  <<else>>
    You aren't sure exactly what you want to do after graduation.  Whether it's as a personal trainer, as a massage therapist,
    <<if $BodyType != 'Plus'>>
      a fitness coach, a nutritionist,
    <</if>>
    or something else, you know you want to do something the health sciences.

    Learning about how the body works and how to improve health and wellness will help you with any of them. You can worry about exactly
    what you want to do further on when you know more about the possibilities.

  You know there are male nurses, but when you were little your friends would tease you.  So you started saying you wanted to be a

  instead of rushing from room to room and only seeing each patient for a few minutes.

  Your developing style focuses on shiny materials like latex and PVC, among others.  And thankfully, the university has an

  The full-body designs often don't offer as much opportunity for creativity, but you enjoy them for other reasons.  You love
  the feeling of latex, tight against your skin.  When it's your whole body, and even your face, it's so much better.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  All your designs incorporate locking zippers, or other mechanisms that can be used to prevent the wearer from removing the
  suit by herself.  Maybe it's the time you spent tied up for Ken, but you also love the feeling of helplessness you get when
  you wear one of your creations.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Locks at the neck means your suit and mask wouldn't come off until the key was returned to you.  And maybe
  <<if setup.haveGirlfriend()>>$dating[0]<<else>>he<</if>>
  might also lock the zipper between your legs too.  Not only would that prevent you from having too much fun, it'd also mean
  you'd have to come begging to be unlocked even to use the bathroom.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  In addition to all that, you also love the feeling of anonymity you get when you are completely covered in latex.  You aren't $playerName

    Bailey is able to help.  You lock the zippers closed, and hand her the keys.  Now you can really experience what it's like when
    you know you won't be able to remove anything until she allows it.

    When she connects your wrist cuffs together behind your back, you are even more helpless.  Of course as horny as you are by then, you

    long until she returns.
    <br><br>
    And when she removes the gag and blindfold again, and you a hard cock she'd brought back for you, what choice do you have but to
    service him too.
    <br><br>
    Afterwards, when you talk with Bailey, to see if she enjoyed herself as much as you did, she has just one suggestion.  "We need a second
    suit. I'd much rather be helpless beside you than in control.  I'm sure we can find a guy willing to hold the keys for both of us."

    She removes the gag and collar when you arrive, but you still can't see.

      But you certainly know the difference between the way a dildo feels in your mouth and the way a real cock does.  You are
    <<else>>
      But you think you can tell it's a dildo pushed into your mouth and not a real cock.  Though some part of you is
    <</if>>
    disappointed that it's the dildo you feel pushed past your lips.  You instinctively wrap them around it.
    <br><br>
    When you hear the machine start up and you feel the dildo begin to move in and out of your mouth, you realize where you are.  She must
    have taken you to her friend from the engineering department.  You wonder if it's just him and $dating[0] watching, or if all his friends
    are there too.
    <br><br>
    Though, it doesn't really matter.  No matter how many people are there, all you can do is let the machine use your mouth for as long
    as they want it to.  And if $dating[0] decides to let him and all his friends want to use your mouth too, there's nothing you can do
    to stop that either.
    <br><br>
    You ache for them to unlock and unzip the zipper between you legs.  But you know if they did, they would see just how wet you are right
    now.

    as well.
    <br><br>
    You can't see where he is or what he is doing.  All you can do is kneel and wait to be used again.  But you don't have to wait all that
    long.  This time he only takes off the gag, leaving you blindfolded.  Your mind can't help but wonder if it's still $dating[0]'s cock
    in your mouth, or if he's decided to share you with his friends.
    <br><br>
    Whether it's still $dating[0] or not, you ache for him to unlock and unzip the zipper between you legs and fuck you.  You know if
    he did, he would see just how wet and ready you already are.  But you are just there to be used, you don't get to decide how you
    are used or for how long.

    you know a couple guys in the engineering department.  They are eager to help you test out your creation while they test out theirs.
    <br><br>
    They have you blindfolded, with your wrists cuffs connected together behind you before leading you into the room with whatever
    machine they have created, so you never see it.  But when you feel the dildo push past your lips you instinctively get to work on
    it.  A moment later you hear the machine start and feel the dildo start moving in and out of your mouth.
    <br><br>
    How long their machine needs to be tested, what speed they want to set it for, or how deep they want it to go, all of it out of your
    control.  You don't even know if it's just the two of them, or if they've called their whole team to watch.
    <br><br>
    You assume they've tested their machine enough when you hear it turn off.  But they aren't done with you yet.  The dildo in your
    mouth is soon replaced by a real cock.  Maybe if they unlocked and unzipped the zipper between your legs and saw how wet and ready you
    are, they'd want to fuck you instead.  But you are just there to be used, you don't get to decide how you are used or for how long.
