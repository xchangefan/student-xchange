Part 16 content
-- If in electronic chastity belt Part 16 and NOT university-wide
  - if dating, leads to submissive wife ending of some kind
  - if not dating, ???
-- If in electronic chastity belt Part 16 and IS university-wide
  - lead to ending regarding that, different ones for chaste, lesbian, etc. modes

- girls not in belts (after more widespread) feeling like they have to or guys aren't interested

-- If was in locked in belt (professor publishing, but you not the one that reported), then lasting addiction to oral

Government conspiracy/involvement? - More widespread use of implants? Or of girls that use them? Or kickbacks from XChange company to overlook things

In Progress:
------------
  - Dorms - If conflict then may end up either reconciling or having to switch rooms and ending up with a guy
  - Women's Studies professor
  
Add, but not started yet
------------
Peter - Hot Wife Ending
Peter - Chastity, but no cuckold ending
Engineering/TestSubject - More cases where chastity belt leads to being owned
Faith - After visit if you fail at ministry path

Continuing
----------
- Make sure there remains a Peter no-cuck path (MFF, but no MMF, or sex with other guys) (Faith as roommate, barista, no side effects)
- Make sure there remains a gold-star lesbian path (Sam as roommate, no side effects)
- Continue with Andrew cuckqueen with Kiera/Marissa
- Part15ThirdTrimester
- Part15Delivery
- More with Dylan's chastity key
- If $MarissaNoSmoke eventually starts smoking in room again, and conflict
- follow ups with FWB or threesome
- if you and roommate don't get along, something later in the year
- Add more Anal when $LoopholeVirgin, during second year and maybe during summer
- Eric relationship
- Chance of getting pregnant from bad aim/leakage/etc if on anal-only

- After week 15
-- Valentines day - special with Eric
-- Something (a different side effect?) if you get pregnant from Dylan?
-- Email/Letter/Phone call later with Justin
-- additional collar upgrades later
-- wedding to Kate (at end of y2-semester 1)
-- PlayerSideEffectOrgasmBlock treatment (as in flunk ending)
-- Continue path for entire time in chastity belt
-- Gold Star Lesbian achievement at relevant endings

Likely:
------------
  - remove oral side effect from excluding factors for professor relationship (what about chastity belt?)
  - Jump to year 2 with various settings: See Slywa's comment
  - Ministry Path -> relationship with Bailey
  - (eg Faith + Anal Love results in 'technically still a virgin' scenes)
  - More dominant content.  Player a dominatrix  (Porn Star path or Call Girl Path)
  - Gold-star lesbian path (Samantha as mentor and then bar job, etc. Maybe also with art/model job)
  - Add additional treatments later if $PlayerCumTreatments set
  - More buddy related achievements: (Bound together? Her and You in chastity together, both pregnant from a threesome)
  - Option to have neighbor as boyfriend with other roommates (currently only Faith and Emily I think)
  - Also end up with Justin if NOT expelled and have the option of dropping out and marrying him, or breaking up
  - Add JobEngineer1 "persuade" to be come engineer to list of possible cross-examination events
  - Slywa: rather than skips, it'd probably be most useful to have a set of options for starting at summer. Especially as content goes into 2nd year, that'd let people more easily explore the different options for new content. It could probably be implemented as essentially built-in saves.
  - T7792: Next, something I assume you plan to change, but if not may want to look at.  In year 2 the relationships with your partners feels very generic, this is particularly true with Barry (until you get on his wife routes) and Paul.  
  Me: I agree, some of them need some attention in a future update.
============================
Maybe:
------------
  - More side effect or results from side effects
  - Way to make it through the summer with academic probation and ministry path - and possibly flunk out?
  - Maybe random chance for extra, intended side effects from father's selections
  - Have birth control pills cause side effect (orgasm denial, or increased libido) sometimes
  - It is possible for you to end the summer with you holding Dylan's chastity key I believe.  But he gives you your key back before you leave to return to school, I may change this in the future so that he keeps your key in some situations.
  - Add story option for veronica + porn star
  - More use of different photos for alternate body types
  - Future interactions with mentors.  One is in a rival sorority for example
  - "Portal panty" simulation with electronic chastity belt. (Guys have sex toy remotely linked that stimulates your belt)
  - Dylan accidently becoming Diane permanently in other lesbian bar paths, similar to with Kate ending
  - Engineering? Design a womanizer-style sex toy that locks on to a piercing and can't be removed by you until unlocked by someone controlling it
  - if graduate with Criminal Justice degree - undercover cop and end up with similar scene to the gang initiation with Emilio
  - Electronic belts detect ovulation/fertile period and alert owner when they should unlock to conceive
  - Electronic belts can prevent wearing of clothing over it. (Maybe set that way as an advertisement?)
  - Electronic belts Option for Anal->Vaginal Redirection and impregnation
  - Do something if have multiple chastity keys
  - Dylan with chastity after summer.  Roommate or X-Change for him (cage falls off when he changes.  He has to put it back on with the key inside of it, so it can only come off with another X-Change pill
  - Add random, "don't have a tampon" event if on period
  - Dealing with cheerleading if on period
  - BF/GF gets the key to Bailey's belt if they have yours
  - Mention robert occasional cleaning sessions where he teases you but doesn't let you get off.
  - Make sure no conflict between Bailey and Eric ?
  - Affect thoughts during Later events, if were previously raped
  - mizunoj: kinda hate how orgasm denial gets automatically countered, without a choice, towards pregnancy things.
    me: For the orgasm denial side effect, I'll add a note to possibly add an option to just regularly take the "treatment" drinks instead.
  - daisycyoas: If you're looking for ideas for optional content you could add some risky experimental therapies to try to get rid of certain side effects or traits acquired during the game, e.g. the exhibitionist trait gained through the librarian job. Those risks could be:
    - random chance the therapy fails with no effect or even a negative effect of gaining another side effect or a worse version of the trait we were trying to get rid of.  
    - getting in debt to pay for the therapy. Could also have a riskier alternative therapy that's free. 
    - getting kidnapped by evil scientists involved in the therapy, possibly a bad end too. 
    - side effect specific risks like some shady guy offering to cure the erotic dreams side effect with hypnosis and using that as an opportunity to take advantage of their hypnotized victim.
  - I'd love to see a power flip with Bailey where YOU start on top and gradually things change over the semester so she's topping you at the end, by picking up enough submissive traits?
  - Allow to go 'no contact' with father at start of game. Would need to replace Christmas/summer - no returning to parents,calls with father, minimumal contact with mother, more visits from brother and sister
  - comment: Which can also lead to Engineering chastity thread where you are literally being trained to be your "husband's" permanently chaste sex slave. Which, i think might also lead one to be trained for bondage and sexy clothes, just as an idea.
  - subcas: Cool. Even though the Paul one is an official ending. I would love if it were extended it get revenge on the ex-wife!
  - LittleCupcake02: A little suggestion considering pure: If choosing the friendly fraternity. How about a couple good Samaritan getting guilt tripped whilst helping the community? Or taken advantage of choices?  Ahem hobo gangbang for example?
  - mizunoj: suggestion on the Faith Pure: wife training chastity path; if you have the implant that prevents pregnancy, then an ending where you end up similar to the Kyle "Stepford Wife" except, you know, free of your own mind and still wanting to orgasm, but permanently denied, willing to please your husband with kinky clothing and bondage. Especially latex, if you chose Fashion for major.  Because, you know, if "i should only be unlocked to be impregnated" and you can't get pregnant, therefore you should never get unlocked..- I may also give the player a "f*** off" option right at the beginning if you start to tell him and then don't like his instructions after that. That option will require me to come up with some alternate content for Christmas and summer breaks though, so that option might take longer to add.

Walkthrough/Guide
----------------
Is there a walkthrough for all the different endings and achievements?

T51bwinterized:
On the Eric path, I'd love if there was a check-back in with Toni and Kara the girls in "paired mode" lesbian chastity.

Another fun idea would be having the paired lesbian mode be applied to Baily x MC. At least the teasing and edging when interacting.

I have a few ideas.

Archaeology A: Somewhat similar in style to the Prince storyline. The university offers you a trip as an assistant to some but dangerous archaeologically interesting area of the world. The expedition's leader can be an unimportant no-name, or someone with character, like a pervy old guy, strict female who's obviously a dominatrix in bed or maybe some goofy old man who'll keep getting the team (or you in particular) in trouble you'll have to deal with on your own. The key element though, is maybe not the archaeological expedition, but the fact that area is an important hub of drug production. This subplot will be either about smuggling or having to somewhat pay for accidentally angering the local drug lords (e.g. by destroying something of theirs or by helping police discover them). The drug lord could be an equivalent of the Prince. One of the potential outcomes of this storyline could be that you find yourself in deep trouble with seemingly no chance for safe escape until out of the blue you're rescued by the DEA or some local special agency who were following you ever since the drug lords contacted you.

Archaeology B: Archaeology A without the drug lord theme and with a supernatural theme. Your expedition discovers a mysterious tomb or an artifact that leads to an adventure with beings from ancient legends. Then you have your supernatural adventure and once you finish it successfully, you wake up like nothing happened, wondering if it was all just a dream (e.g. something fell on your head inside the tomb and you don't bother telling your crew what you saw because they'd just think you imagined it while unconscious). Optionally there could be some bad ends where we stay in the legendary being's realm forever as a concubine or something like that.

Me: Look at the "bind on equip / cursed items" subreddits for ideas on artifacts

Psychology: This opens up options for all kinds of experiments. Hypnosis, closed environment experiments (on either side, very similar to the two sides of the Engineering Department Assistant coin), or maybe spending some time in a straitjacket in a closed psychiatric ward (reasons could be: participating in some experiment, or going in undercover to investigate something for a good-guy professor interested in troubling rumors, or being sent there as a result of an intrigue of a sleazy guy we turned down). Other than the experiment stuff, this major should open up options for short events related to researching sexuality.

Are you open to adding those "never available, but mentioned" majors later or are they supposed to stay like that for good?

Winterized:
Kate content this update wasn't especially substantial. Mostly because a lot of the new or focused content this update was on the engineering/chastity, on Academic Probation, on new jobs, on the women's studies class, and on the Buddy. Of those system's, the only one she interacts with besides a very brief buddy one off, is the probation system. But, the new Kate ending feels like a legit missed mark. Mostly because in terms of sexual content it's 2/3rds built around Dylan, who gets more numerous and lengthy passages then Kate. But, honestly I play this game for the female chastity+ BDSM not the tf, so the lezdom ending with more tf then lezdom was a huge clunker. Maybe less so for someone more into TF. But, just on the level of good story sense, if the focus of a route is mostly on the PC + Kate relationship then the most important task of the ending is tosome kind of closure.

In terms of specific actionable feedback. I don't think the Dylan stuff in the ending is bad, in of itself. It's more the absence of what should be in there. It needs at least a few (Obviously I'd like more then a few, and she is a popular character. But there's only so much writing that can be done) passages exploring the core questions?

What does their life together look like? Now that there's no constraints on a real life for the PC, how does it evolve? Full time Lesbian Pet? 1950s housewife but Gay? Dylan becomes her pet too? You break up and find a new Mistress? You get inseminated to have a kid? Kate gets bored of being a Domme and becomes a sub to someone else? There's a lot of really good options of you're ever in the mood to expand it and give it some teeth.

Of the ones I mentioned "24/7 Pet" and "Lesbian 50s Wife" work best with the dropout theme, while the others aren't dropout specific. And Dylan threesome works best with the stuff you did with him in the ending already. But, it's all suggests and I'm sure you actually have already had plenty of good or even better ideas on the subject.

Wouldn't mind some spanking content but the way I see the father is that, while old fashioned, he's not very prone to micromanage his women (wife and daughters) and "steps in" only when he feels like he has to, like a true gorilla alpha male :P. So yeah I wouldn't mind spankings during the home visits, but only if certain conditions are met, so no punishments for wearing a skirt that's a little too short or for chatting with a random guy at the mall.
AllOfThem: Oh, absolutely. Nothing absurd (... despite the game's content being, well...), but serious concerns. Failing at college, the photo scenario you mentioned in the follow up paragraph, those kinda things. Similar to how he reacts to seeing you in the strip club.

Very quiet in here as we all wait for updates/new both in game and on forum, so I thought I would fill the silence with a few ideas for routes that had been running around my head.

Idea 1. Ballet/Dance Route
Fetishes: exhibitionism, bondage/BDSM, objectification, age difference, latex, prostitution
Ballet/Dance would be added as an option for characters with either petite or standard bodies. (A possibility of making your body flexible in initial choices could open up new stuff) It would be available at the Job/activity fair, and would be an option that your father approves of on that route. While training in such an art would usually require years of training from a young age, it is well in reason to say the X-change pill gives you the flexibility required.

I could see this route going potentially 3 ways. Providing of course the routes are pursued, similar to how the barista route can be casual employment or lead down the Andrew Path, army wife path etc.

a) Traditional route - the ballet/dance group would be run by Mr and Mrs Dance (no relation, insert east European names). If you follow Mr Dance's route you become a classically trained ballerina, and is the route to take if you want to avoid any sexual encounters that might interfere with routes outside of the activity.

b) Prima Ballerina route - Having taken Mr Dance's initial route, you will eventually hit upon a choice. The choice appearing could be whether you picked 'good student' in the beginning, or perhaps had the 'flexibility' perk if implemented. The choice Mr Dance will give you will be to continue dancing casually, or go into a more serious class if you want to pursue it as a career. The first choice would lead you down route a., the second would lead you down this storyline. Prima Ballerina would be a more serious and professional discipline, hence instead of holidays spent going to the beach with classmates, you would instead attend dance camps and go to performances. This route then splits into 4.
- Mr Dance is obviously attracted to you, despite being more than twice your age. However he is professional and will not make advances on you. Main Character (MC) could choose to start a relationship with him, but would require you to leave the dance program. Mr Dance is a very loving relationship despite the age difference, and you eventually become a dance instructor yourself and/or start a family with him - ENDING: Dance Teacher
- You eventually get close to a fellow dancer, and eventually become a duo together, both on stage and off. You both have long and successful careers, before settling down and starting a family if you so choose. - ENDING: Entwined
- If you do not get into a relationship, you rise through the ranks over the years, and eventually you star in a world-class performance in Paris. There, as you dazzle the crowd, you enrapture the eye of the Crown Prince of *insert country with monarchy*. He makes contact after the performance, and you start dating. After some time the King/Queen dies, and he ascends to the throne. He asks you to stay with him, and if you say yes, you marry and become Queen Consort. Unlike the Royal Concubine ending this would be a full on Royal Ending. It would end with you having kids and securing the future of his line. - ENDING: Royal Family
- The final ending would see no serious relationships chosen during your time as a dancer. You would rise through the ranks to be the best Prima Ballerina in the world, obtaining heights obtained by few before you, and becoming a household name across the globe. Eventually you make your final performance after a sold-out world tour, the story ends with the crowd standing and applauding both you and your career. - ENDING: Prima Ballerina

c) Burlesque route - This route requires you to continue under Mrs Dance's tutelage, and is the more fetishistic route to take. It would include venturing into the more risqué areas of dance, or perhaps quitting dance altogether and becoming a plaything for Mrs Dance and/or the wealthy of society. The route would start after accepting Mrs Dance's offer of 'alternative' dancing styles, which would begin a slow descent into depravity. This route should be quit-able until a certain point, after all Mrs Dance is not doing anything illegal and Mr Dance is aware that not everyone will be comfortable with her methods. This route would have 2 branches, one being larger than the other.
- Firstly would simply be the burlesque dance route. While you are wearing less on stage than perhaps a normal dancer would, what you are wearing is far more extravagant. This route would not have an ending, rather an achievement and would eventually end back onto the main storyline.
- The second route requires you to accept Mrs Dance offer of quitting the main groups and joining her own private company. Whether she is truthful about it or not, this company very much consists or 18+ performances, including but not limited to sex on stage, dancing in bondage, and any props being people in tied positions.
- You very much catch the eye of Mrs Dance, especially when you are performing in bondage or as a piece of furniture. Mrs Dance offers you a place by her side, but it is not an equal relationship. You are instead instructed to wear full latex and act as her personal servant/maid/slave/chair. If you wanted to get dark she does not have any true feelings for you besides lust, and you are simply added to the collection of other dancers constricted in her house. - ENDING: Spider and the Fly
- If you decline the offer, you continue as a burlesque dancer, but stumble upon another way Mrs Dance makes money; selling her dancers to clients. Never a permanent deal, it could be for as little as an hour, or as long as a fortnight if they are hosting an event. Eventually you settle, or even embrace the lifestyle. - ENDING: Black Swan


That was longer than I expected, anyways onto next idea

Idea 2. Farmhand Route
Fetishes: Pregnancy, lactation, expansion, Hucow, incest?, is being a housewife a fetish?, maid, petplay, brainwashing

Two ways this route could come about. Firstly it could be a job/activity, similar to my idea for ballet/dance. This would require longer trips, and would take up holiday time. My second idea for implementing this route would be upon the selection of the agriculture major, which mentions your grandfather owning a farm, but doesn't go anywhere. Personally I am more a fan of the agriculture major path, as it adds some later came content and doesn't cluster the opening job options.
I do not think this route should be as big as my proposed dance route. It would be a job that runs beside the main storyline and leads to a few bad ends if you make the 'wrong' choices. If you graduate with the major you'll take over your grandfathers farm and would lead to a few more endings.

a) Graduation route - Requires graduating in agriculture, as well as not being in a restrictive relationship and/or pregnant (think Andrew, woman in the Bar, Barry etc.). Upon graduation you would start a job as a farmhand underneath your grandfather, with the agreement being that if you can help him run the farm satisfactorily, he will hand over the reigns to you. This route would have 3 branches all with their own ending.
- If you are in a relationship, and your partner offers you their help on the farm, you both move onto the property. Eventually your grandfather hands over the property and retires, with you and your now husband/wife taking over and starting a family. - ENDING: Big Sky Country
- If you are not in a relationship, you still take over the farm, although your grandfather stays on a bit longer. Eventually he offers for one of your cousins to come out and help, as they've expressed interest in the past. If you decline he accepts your choice, and you start running the farm by yourself. - ENDING: Farmer wants a wife (aussie tv show)
- If you do accept your grandfather's offer, he gives you two choices depending on gender preference. Your cousin arrives and is very friendly, helping around the farm. However over time they become more domineering, and start restricting you to more household chores as well as beginning a relationship with you. Your grandfather passes on the farm but to them instead of you. - ENDING: Farmer's wife (cousin can be changed to friend of the family if you want to steer away from cousin relationship)

b) In service to the farm route - achieved by helping out on the farm before the graduation. This route requires you stuffing up on the farm in some way or another, and in so doing requires you to drop out of school and fix your mistakes.
- Hucow path aka. human developing cow-like aspects like excessive lactation and/or transformation. Achieved two possible ways. First is over times working at the farm your grandfather brings up an experimental new feed for his cows that may boost milk production. It seems to succeed. Eventually your grandfather leaves you in charge of the farm for the weekend as he is visiting family. While feeding the cows on the Friday night, you discover one of the milking machines is broken. If you attempt to fix it yourself instead of calling someone, it senses a 'cow' and restrains you, beginning to force feed you the mixture. Come Sunday afternoon you are found by your grandfather, but by then your breasts have swelled and lactating heavily. While he does unhook you, eventually you both realize the state of the changes and you go back (happily?) to the machine. - ENDING: Hooked up
- alternatively you could try the feed over time, producing a slow transformation.
- alternatively if you are seeking a bad end, the feed could produce further side effect, reducing intelligence to a point where your grandfather keeps you hooked up.
- After working on the farm you accidentally start a fire, if MC makes the wrong choices you cause a significant amount of damage, and cause your grandfather to lose a lot of money. Furious, your grandfather drags you to the Uni offices, and demanding compensation for what he calls the fault of the X-Change pill. The uni offers two alternative solutions.
- Firstly they offer a pill that would make you docile and hardworking, a perfect farmhand/maid/servant. This would make his life easier so he could focus on repairing. If this path is chosen MC thinks of nothing but helping on the farm, and when he hands the reigns over to someone else you become the servant of them. - ENDING: drone
- Secondly they offer an alternative pill, which would change your physiology to replace the cow killed in the fire. This is the second route for hucow. However this pill changes you far more, reducing intellect, changing voicebox to only produce moos, growing the start of horns and weakening your legs to the point of crawling everywhere. You become the best producing 'cow' on the farm, and your milk becomes famous (although no one knows its true source). Seeing an opportunity your grandfather doesn't change you back. - ENDING: Moo?

I think that's all the ideas for now. I know further incest choices was something you wanted to steer clear of, although I considered cousin to be a bit more acceptable than father or sibling. Obviously the second route could be changed to include the grandfather, but I thought it best to avoid it in the idea itself.

Not sure if there are fetishes/kinks included that you wanted to avoid. These two ideas have been in my head for some time so I thought I would finally write them out. If I come up with anything else I will post it.

Would love feedback or further questions or expansions of the idea.

Winterized:
Okay. So, I am now reasonably sure I got all of the major content this release. Though if I don't comment on something important feel free to ask/comment and I'll see if I missed it.

First, the sorority party has all sorts of bugs, and all the sexual encounters in it didn't really do a good job accounting for chastity. There were scenes where My character was in a cyber belt and baily was in chastity but they were still "going orgasm to orgasm".

Here's my full feedback:

It's a good release with a ton of content. Two years of work would sort of demand it would be. Though, one does get the impression it wasn't two years of continuous progress. Still, it was COVID, no one can be blamed for that.

What I Like:

With a game this big the obvious area where things might live or die is just in focus. To do every route with the same level of meticulous detail would be murderously difficult. But, the spots where attention has been paid all really feel it:

- The buddy program works, and the character of Baily is a clever addition. She's sort of a sort of "mini-me" kind of character, and by virtue of that comes across with more personality than most of the cast. The notion of "shaping" is also fun, adding a clearer area where the game can both reflect the player's transformation and give the player a bit of agency.

- The changes to Faith are great for the most part. There's a bit of a lull around the middle of Semester 1 if you don't have Barry as a roommate. But, the semester 2 "good girl chastity" stuff all lands well and is well done. Same with the Andrew variant of it. But, the real MVP is Barry, which is hilarious because it's such a random variable. But, the multiple temptation scenes make for great buildup. It also does a great job repurposing the pet vacation into something of an act climax, before moving to the unified Act 2. The Mike variant was fun. All in all, really strong additions.

- All the stuff pertaining to the engineering job, both as a subject and as an engineer are just great. A lot of fun was had here, and its setup for more great stuff in version 16. The Engineer versions are slightly better than the Pure, Andrew, Peter, and Tester versions, if only because there was more conflict/challenge there. Both of the Engineer Academic Probation bad ends are among my favorite stuff in the entire thing. But, the Eric stuff isn't bad either. It's definitely the highlight of the update.

- There's a lot of fun to be had with the Academic probation stuff and dropout mechanics. Maid was fun a fun one off. Tutoring was dull but fine-ish. The extended dropout ending sequence was overall pretty good, and one of the only areas where permanent transformation really seemed the matter. In terms of the character specific dropouts, Barry was a clear winner, if only because him ditching the PC to f*** the maid is a "barry move".

- Some of the jobs were given really good stuff. Besides Engineering, Model's expansion was also pretty fun and did a lot with the material. It feels like it should be slightly less linear. But, I do appreciate the fact that it has direction. Cheerleader got some good stuff. The stripper ending is fun. Library SEEMS like it's going in a fun direction, but you've only really done the settup for it.

- I'mma hold back my thoughts on the teacher investigation mini-plot, just because it seems that some versions aren't altogether done. But, I'll mostly say I like what I got so far and it seems alright.

- Skip function is a big step up. But, for searching around for material, it might be better if you allowed a single choice on the player's choice regarding uncle mike. Because it defaulted to him a lot, and it has potential to mess with a bunch of routes. If you want to add the skip function to anything, do it to the Spring Break segment. That shit is the bane of a completionist's existence. It's long, has very little plot relevance, It's filled with choices that don't allow for easy skipping but none of those choices have much long term impact. Easy skip option. (Or just add a version where you don't go on spring break besides the relationship ones and the pure one. Something like spend it studying.)

- Overall, while I'm not personally a fan of expanded gender TF stuff, that's just me talking. From a writer's perspective, I can see why you leaned on it a little more this time around, and the update is probably stronger for it. So long as I can continue to *mostly* avoid it or at least the most dramatic aspects of it, it's all fine to me. But, I can definitely see it as a stronger move.

What I thought could use improvement:

- While it makes sense to make the buddy a singular character with the same attributes each time. I did come out feeling like the influence options weren't quite what I wanted. The point of the character is as kind of a mirror, so she's a good spot to add more choices. In particular, I didn't like that when I was doing the pure route(s) that she always ended up a cock hungry gobbler. I feel as if there should be choices to influence her towards being more conservative. The only situations where I actually felt I had any influence at all were the routes where she became the characters GF, chastity related content, and turning her gay or not. Some things that might be fun could also be some ability to push her towards different times of stuff (Rough sex vs pet play vs humiliation and degradation vs etc etc). Another might be a chance to change her style slightly while picking clothes. Maybe make the player always pick clothes for her, and give the player the option to move her towards different styles sort of like what the mentor does at the start of Year 1? Like, you can pick between conservative/slutty/etc. But, also maybe if you meet certain conditions (Roomed with Olivia or are slave of Kate) can push her towards kink clothing. Stuff like that which improves the "customization" vibe.

- Faith content is mostly great, but it has the potential to have a very abrupt feeling end if you break off the chastity. It needs to give her one more appearance where she can twist the knife of the MC's failure a bit. Really emphasize that fall from grace.

- Actually, just generally, giving the Year 1 mentor a one segment re-appearance to say high and reflect on how much shit had changed would be cool. They all kinda vanish, despite being some of the most fleshed out characters, and they'd make a nice barometer for progress.

- With the exception of the buddy, who has a good deal of personality, I wasn't taken by any of the new relationship options. Jayden is very boring so far, and I didn't get a single personality detail from him that stuck. Justin has the military thing, but he's eh too. Eric is better, because he has more personality. The mischievous aspect, the engineer/nerd aspect, having a built in kink with the chastity stuff. But, quite frankly, he's not that great either. Ironically, I actually thought that Kyle was a lot better than Eric. That's because Kyle had an actual motive. He was jealous about the way that the MC got special treatment/acted superior and was trying to bring her down a peg. But, Eric doesn't really have that? Quite frankly, Eric might benefit significantly from being folded into Kyle slightly so they're the same character? But, he also could benefit from contrasting with Kyle more too, perhaps showing their different methods and outlooks on the MC? Because, right now Eric is just "more boring Kyle"

- I was pretty underwhelmed by the character specific Dropout and academic probation endings. Barry had the best one, but even it was a very qualified positive. The Kate one in particular rankled me, for the reasons I mentioned in my earlier post (Why is the Kate ending like 50%/60% Dylan?). But, overall the impression I got is that they didn't really ask the question "If my character dropped out, how would that change her relationship". The Kate one in particular is noticeable, because the ending seems like it's exactly the same as if she didn't drop out. But, it feels like there should be more substantial changes in their relationship that would happen over time if the player became totally dependent on Kate. The same is true for the other versions too, but less so. Like, I get the impression that Barry would have exploited her more then we saw, though overall it was fine. It's Kate in particular that really stood out to me as a flop.

- The game doesn't really respond to the orgasm block from probation very well, outside of the chastity routes. There's some variables here and there. But, it feels like it should reflect more of a shift in the relationships. Like, Kate goes through all the trouble of getting her own cyber belt for the MC, and she shrugs off the fact that the MC can't cum? There's a lot of potential for it with some of the other routes too. Will elaborate in content ideas.

- I'll mention roommates briefly, because I didn't get a lot this release. But, the impression I get is that is mostly a case of "more is planned". However, I will say that while the nerd roommate and the stoner roommate fill a clearer gap in terms of characters, the slut roommate feels too much like the slut roommate from Year 1. When you do expand her, try to focus on what makes her not a retread.

- I like most of the job stuff, there's some problem areas. Bikini Barista felt eh to me, with the exception of the "temptation" version of the pure route where it works better. It fails mainly because, by the point you're a rampaging sex machine at the start of year 2, it's rather on the tame side. I didn't try all the job variants. I will say that the call girl scenes were kinda eh to me. Also they probably needed to be more player responsive. Just because it felt odd that my character with points in submission was going around doming people.

- Prior relationships. This is the area where I felt the update was most "incomplete". The relationship segments for Veronica, Kate, Aaron, Non-Dominant Peter, Barry, and Josh felt like they were in "maintenance" mode during this stretch of game. The scenes for them were very small and didn't feature changes in status quo. Barry also felt much "tamer" then his asshole self from Year 1. The ones who can co-exist with probation (Josh, Kate, Barry) didn't really respond to the MC losing ability to orgasm. I do get, at least on some level, that this stretch of the game is really more about introducing the new story elements (Women's Studies, Buddy Program, Job Changes, Probation, Chastity Shenanigans). But, I would like a bit more with them in the areas where it's well supported. How are the living conditions having moved in with Barry different then moving in with Josh?

But, the biggest slam against this stretch is that too many of the scenes were identical based on partner. The identical Halloween sex scenes in particular stood out as an area where deviation was trimmed in a way with negative impacts. Same with the "copy & paste" versions of the buddy threesome. A threesome with Barry, a threesome with Aaron, and a threesome with Josh should all feel very different from each other, or else it risks the characters not feeling different enough.

- I get not overloading the game with "new parent" stuff. But, it does feel kind of odd how *completely* the child vanishes after giving birth. If you want the pregnancy system to be meaningful, you can give it a bit more. At least a solid passage or two.

- This is a small thing. But, it's too easy to get pregnant, if the player is on the pill. The probability is way fucked, and I swear that she's getting knocked up every semester, even on the pill.

- I see the point of the "what else is going on this week" mini options near the bottom and they're not bad. But, they really do need to be kept to very small stuff. Like a few sentences max. There was a time you tried to fit whole ass passages there and it was just too small to support it. Also, anything that took actual mental processing felt disjointed because it was in the same passage segment as something unrelated.

Suggestions for Further Development:

- This one is obvious. Smaller, shorter release cycles. A release is perfectly fine, even if you don't advance the week cycle that much. I get you felt you had to do the entire first half of the semester in one go. But, it's alright to just note where the cut off point for certain contents bit are, and then just do them one at a time.

- It feels like the variable spam in the game is getting pretty nasty, and more of it needs to be tied in loose ends. I actually really appreciate some stuff like Stripper, Web Model, and Master Robert routes coming endings. Because it feels like the game should start cleaning up variables, so it doesn't become too behemoth to ever write. Some of the major relationships should be looking to reach an ending. Either a "this relationship ends" or a "fast forward to an ending" type of option. Off the top of my head:

Andrew into a proposal that either sends the player down the existing endings, plus a fast forward type deal for the Andrew Cyber-Chastity Plot.
Barry Pet (post-island) can probably start heading towards an accelerated ending. Otherwise, a breakup style situation, like he dumps you because he gets bored of you and he's a fickle bitch.
Aaron and Kate (could) both use more story content, provided you decide on what to do with them (see next point). But, they're also both rapidly approaching a point where you can fast forward a bit to give them a proper ending. They're both some of my favorite routes, so it would be a shame to close them off. But, if you really don't have a lot more to do with them in terms of plot movement, you might as well.
Josh is boring. He is very very boring. I get you need a vanilla guy in there. But, there's plenty of chances to introduce a more interesting vanilla character. So he's another good target for a "marry and fast forward OR breakup" type deal.
Peter and Veronica though, both are in a good spot for sustaining their stories.

- I think a lot of the issues you're running into with the romance partners, is that a lot of them just aren't really interesting enough as characters to really stay around after they finished their basic deal.

Barry is basically a one note character, and his one note is that he's an asshole who likes humiliating you. But, that's essentially reached it's climax with the BDSM Island plotline. Now what? He doesn't have hobbies, he doesn't have a major or aspirations, he doesn't have any external relationships with other characters, his view of the protagonist as a fuckpet doesn't really evolve. You COULD do an entire arc about Barry emotionally evolving to care about the protagonist as a human being. Showing almost tsundere moments of kindness amidst the abuse, until he eventually works his way into a good Master. But, he doesn't have that kind of character detail yet.

I think a lot of character kind of hit a doldrum because they ran out of material that their broad archetype can sustain. Like, suppose the player and Kate get married. What happens then? What does Kate do for a living? What about her relationship to other women? What does she want out of life? What does she want out of a partner? Is she the type who'd cheat? The type who'd be too controlling? The type who uses her own strength to hide emotional vulnerabilities? Yadda yadda yadda.

And Aaron? Why does he have a tendency to go for younger women? How much of his affection is genuine and kind? How does he feel about being a university professor? Is he happy with it? What does he like to do for fun? There's a lot of potential to do some fun stuff with the fact that he's a university professor and probably a smart guy. How does he respond to different versions of the protagonist? Does he prefer a smart schoolgirl who understands his work? Or does he secretly prefer a dumb girl who he can lecture a bit too?

Eric in particular, I think, has a lot of potential. I suggested combining him with Kyle before, just because Kyle has a clear motivation in his initial jealousy and loathing of the protagonist. But if you don't, it might be better to up the contrast and have him *like* the MC, even while keeping her a fuckpet. There's a lot of potential, in that this is the only route where they're both nerds. You can give them some real chemistry in the fact that that they're colleagues at the exact same time that he's slave training her with the belt. Either positive romantic chemistry, or negative loathing "rival" energy. But, just generally you can do a lot more with it.

Basically, it will be a lot easier to keep the storylines of some of these people going for another 3 in-game years worth of material, if you can make them more interesting as human beings and make their motives more complex and evolving.

TLDR: Liked Chastity, Purity, and Buddy. Didn't like expansions on old relationships. Think the characters need to be more defined and more routes need closing.

Postponed, maybe return to it after game is completed:
- Story mode (Postponed), maybe a replay mode that others can make instead
Re-enable story mode later when things are stable, verify existing endings and add all endings

============================
Future Endings:
- W/Veronica
- Ending with Jayden
- Cuck queen additional ending (with roommate from year 2 as Cuckcake)

University Backstory
- X-Change donating to university and bribing officials to look the other way on issues, paying off people so they don't complain

Other suggestions:
- A personal favorite would be a cheerleader to an athlete story for sure.

AllOfThem:
One thing that I wouldn't mind seeing would be more refusal options during the side effects bonanza.

Specifically the easy/powerful orgasms side effects, which currently have no refusal options.

Now, I get it - why would anyone refuse such side effects? More pleasure for free!

But well, the player PoV can be somewhat different, and I feel like there are in-character reasons one might refuse (or be refused) those:
the player character is of the Faith variety and would rather not be led astray
the player doesn't get a choice - it's a medical test program, after all. Excessive orgasm effects could negatively affect results, therefore the program runners say 'No' in the player character's stead. Could be paired with a cash bonus. Choose the cash bonus before the side effects (simple checkbox on a preceding page, I imagine), lose your chance at many super orgasms... unless two side effect cancellers are already in effect. Positive side effects and the money, suck it, bitches
I thought about maybe also making it a parental choice, but implementation would probably be considerably more complicated, so eh.


renee98 : (It would also be cool but harder to implement if eventually faith was brought into the relationship (w/Barry) as well as another pet.)

NetDenizen1147:
Well, different people view Incest in different ways. I personally like the idea of romantic incest, family love changing to romantic and sexual love, so the possibility of some kind of relationship forming between the player and their brother would appeal to me, especially if that relationship resulted in or was created as a result of a pregnancy. More outright choices to pursue sex with Dylan, sexting from the dorm room, etc.

UsagiTripleSix:
I feel like this (quickly getting porn-payoff) is one area where this “game” far excels over others.
Way too many games are really slow-burns, or just become endless teases (my own game being utterly
guilty of these), while this one has quick “payoff” without coming across as completely jarring.

Is it just me, though? I actually found the beginning section where you choose your options and
discover the side-effects to be the hottest part of the whole thing. :lol: It’s what got me invested
in the first place.

It does bring me to my main gripe, which is that I wish it was more obvious what the different
side-effects were doing, and that they were played up a bit more. I’m assuming many of them just
result in the player character automatically hooking up when there might’ve been an option,
otherwise, but I’d think something like having multiple levels of “super-easy-orgasm” would
have a dramatic impact on some sex events.

It’s been a really long time since I last played it, though, so I’m just going from memory.
...
This game introduced me to the X-change pill concept. At first, I thought the game was a
reference to the Japanese VN series of X-Change games. I love the concept, even if the
simplicity makes it harder to suspend disbelief.

As far as revisiting older parts of the game, goes… Since replayability seems like a strong
point (especially with trying out different side-effects), what I’d love to see is more
“width” added to the beginning. By that, I mean there are certain parts of the game that
have started to feel like a slog on repeat play-throughs (going home to see your family,
for instance). It’d be great to have more alternatives in the sections everyone has to go
through repeatedly.

Anyway, I'll be excited to check out the next update. :D

Add me to the "excited to see it's still being worked on" group. I love the branching
options and all the different endings.
Hopefully there are more fully Lesbian options in the update as well!

My ideas for future storylines.

Father expansion. The new father choice at the start opens up some potential new avenues. Obviously your father has a conservative way of seeing women and their role in the relationship; with women being submissive to their husbands and obeying them. I think it would be interesting to see him take this further. Ideas like the following

- Instead of the chaste wife ending, a graduating player who is a) single and b) went with his choices, is 'auctioned' off by your father in an arranged marriage, one that he approves of. I believe this would work best if there are further choices for your life that he suggests, and if you follow them leads down this path. E.g. what your major is, sorority choices, even roommates.

- It's noted that your sister has issues with your father. Perhaps in the future your father tricks or coerces your sister into taking an X-change pill that keeps her female but makes her submissive and obedient, this could expand to the brother and even mother as well.

- Finally could be a branch of the chaste wife storyline. If your character has had sex with the brother and/or uncle, you can have sex with your father and begin a secret relationship.

I don't think your father has sinister intentions at the start, but I feel if the right choices (or wrong choices) are made, the power he has over his family could go to his head, and he could have a stepford wives/handmaid's tale future. (I know the former is technically already in game). Perhaps he suggests an ultra-conservative club for you to join, which shares his views on women. Maybe he does/doesn't realize how traditionalist they actually are.


**Me** Most likely one to implement:
In relation to the father storyline, I wish the Uncle storyline could be slowed down a bit and/or expanded upon. My idea for this would be he opens your submissiveness to him slowly, starting with 'innocent' acts of obedience but eventually exacting more and more control over you. Perhaps he asks you to fetch him a drink first, then makes you wear the ex's clothes, until eventually perhaps over several holidays you become a willing slave. Of course the current way should be kept in, just an alternate route.
Also I hope it gets implemented that there is a way to submit to him without your brother f***ing you.


**Me** Maybe:
A sub-branch of the concubine route that ends up with you marrying into royalty and becoming Princess/Queen. Doesn't have to be the prince in game, maybe you meet a prince from a far-away kingdom and really hit it off? Then do you continue your relationship with this new prince, or go after the older but more powerful widowed king? A route that ends with real power would be interesting in my opinion.

A ballet club or dance club would be interesting, as another choice for first jobs. Ballet dancing is high intensity with pressure both from on and off the stage, take the chance to be a white, pure swan, or succumb to your desires and embody the black swan.

Finally would be a branch at the end of the obedient wife, perhaps on the bdsm island, that ends up with you and Andrew having a poly relationship, with him having 2 sub wives. Unlike the other poly ending this is still a really loving marriage, not just built around sex. If not poly perhaps obedience is taken further, ending up closer to a maid/slave than a wife.

Still, whatever future routes and ending you have planned, I am eagerly looking forward to them. (and if you want to ask questions about my ideas I am happy to answer and stretch them out)

Def. an interesting concept. Basically just needs an expansion of candidates beyond the ones we have now. Can easily have the player being given a choice within the father's suggestions, too. Maybe with preceding dating storylines, allowing the player to experience each candidate a bit before making a choice (but risking the father's intervention if refusing to choose).

A bit much. The dev has already noted that the father is 'Old Fashioned' but not malevolent. While he did admittedly pick the submissive option for the player character, this was presumably to make the player character more feminine. The father would come off as distinctly more unpleasant a person than he is right now if he forced this on your sister/mother.

Current fluff also has him shaping you to be a bit like his ideal wife, implying your mother to be rather more independent and less kinky than your father dreams of. While this could lead to the father taking matters for her and your sisters in his own hands, I actually like the alternative better - that there is a degree of potential conflict between him and his rather more independent-minded wife, which could in turn impact the player character.

The daughter is a bit of a different matter, primarily because she's actually pretty kinky herself. I'm less thinking chemical adjustments here, however, and more given hands-on guidance, which might lead to submission similar to yourself, but might also lead to resistance from her and her taking a more dominant path. Say, if you get it on with her and your brother, she ends up accepting her father's behavioral/disciplinary demands, and ends up more submissive, if you only get it on with your brother or no-one, she ends up more independent-minded.
- Finally could be a branch of the chaste wife storyline. If your character has had sex with the brother and/or uncle, you can have sex with your father and begin a secret relationship.
Already been shot down by the dev, and I'd tend to agree with him. I like the old-fashioned father stereotype rather more than the incest stereotype.
I don't think your father has sinister intentions at the start, but I feel if the right choices (or wrong choices) are made, the power he has over his family could go to his head, and he could have a stepford wives/handmaid's tale future. (I know the former is technically already in game). Perhaps he suggests an ultra-conservative club for you to join, which shares his views on women. Maybe he does/doesn't realize how traditionalist they actually are.
As long as it doesn't move to father/daughter incest, that does sound fine. Well. Handmaid's Tale would be a bit much, I think. But in principle, could be interesting.

Though the dev also needs to be careful with not branching too much, which just leads to getting lost while slowing the development of extant storylines. I'm honestly amazed by how much it has already branched and still keeps going, which is a rather impressive feat.
