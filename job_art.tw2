  From how much you clearly enjoyed the previous assignment, you’ve been given a special assignment. Now are you are modeling for a famous
  photographer who is a guest instructor at the school this year.

  As they carefully tie your arms and legs, his assistant explain the erotic nature of his photographs. She explains that his work
  explores the beauty of the female body, and the transcendent joy of a woman’s orgasm. “Would you like to be a part of that?”, she
  asks you.
  Your head is still untied, and you quickly nod.

  She strokes your clit as your feel your pleasure building. You watch the photographer just sitting, watching her work, not
  photographing anything. After a while, she stops stroking and you feel a dildo slide effortlessly into you. You feel your orgasm building closer and closer as she fucks you with the dildo.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  “Now.”, the photographer says as he  finally stands and ready’s his camera.
<</nobr>>

  The assistant leaves the dildo inside you, securing it with a rope. “I’ll let you cum when he’s finished.”, she whispers in your ear as
  she ties the rope to your hair.

  This time you are alone with the photographer in his private studio. He ties you similar to before, but this time he hoists you into the air, forcing you to arch your
  back and part your legs. He teases your nipples a bit until they are erect and then begins tying string around each and securing them to the frame.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  “I’m sure once you see my vision, you’ll want to be the subject that brings it to life.”, he tells you as he shows you a series of sketches he’s made,
  all of you, bound as you are now. In the first drawing you see yourself exactly as you are now, but with the flush of a recent orgasm plain on your body,
  cum dripping out of you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Each one after shows your belly growing larger and larger. The final photo shows you still bound, your belly at it’s largest, and a look of pain on your
  face and sweat dripping from your body.
