	<h1>Job/Activity Fair</h1>
	Welcome back ladies. I hope everyone had a good first day in their new bodies.  I hope everyone took the time to get to know your mentors a bit better as well.
	Most of you probably hit it off right away.  Although, for some of you, it might take a while for you to grow on each other.
	But if you have any difficulties, remember, your mentor is only trying to look out for you, as best she sees how.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	I can see you all had fun on your shopping trips yesterday as well.  The first shopping trip was on us.  But you'll need some money of your own for the next one.
	Which brings us to today's event.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	We’ve lined up several local employers with job openings that some of you may qualify for. These include both on and off campus employers.

<</nobr>>

<<print "There are also some representatives from the athletic department here as well. Those positions aren’t technically allowed to pay you. But they do offer scholarships that would cover some of your tuition. That means you’d get to keep some of the money X-Change would have paid to the school. So it works out about the same as if they did pay you.">>

<<print "Before you head out to the fair, talk to your mentor. She may have another job for you to think about while you’re looking over your other options.">>

<<print "But keep in mind the choice is yours. Well, yours and the employers. Your mentor is just giving you another option to choose from.">>

				I looked through the jobs out there. Most of them look ok, I guess, but some of them... well, I just hope their parents
				don’t learn how they earn their money.  I’m glad my parents give me enough I don’t have to worry about a job at school.
				I hope I still meet my future husband while I’m here, and I never have to work outside the home. But I guess that’s not

				Anyway, I know this guy, Andrew, who’d be perfect for you. To hire you I mean. He’s here working on his business degree, but he also
				manages the coffee shop on campus. His dad actually owns the whole chain of stores. Andrew will be running it all in a few years.
				Most girls think he’s handsome too. I’m sure he’ll make someone a wonderful husband some day.
				<br><br>
				Why don’t I set you two up for a dat... a dinner meeting. So he can get to know you and see about a job for you.
				Even if he doesn’t have a job, I’m sure you’ll have a great time. One of the dresses we bought earlier will be perfect for
				your... meeting.

			work with me, as I’m their other model! Plus we get to keep a lot of what we model too!
			<br><br>
			The other thing is, master didn’t want you to feel pressured to take the job. He said to take it only if you wanted it. You can also decide to only

      Olivia says that if you decide on one of the jobs at the fair, her master will make sure your boss has a copy of your belt’s key. That way
      they’ll be able to take it off if you need to be unbelted for practice, or work,... or whatever.  He’ll just make them promise to make sure
      it’s back on when you leave.  Let me know what you decide on.
			<br><br>
      As good as it sounds getting out of this stupid belt, even for a little while at work, it makes you wonder why that'd be necessary.
      You wonder if it'd be safer just finding your own job instead.  You saw a "Now Hiring" sign at the [[coffee shop|JobChasteBarista]] you
      visited earlier, maybe you could try there.

  Though as you watch Andrew walk away, you think that maybe you wouldn't have minded him having the key as much as you would have
  one of the creepy, middle-aged guys you were expecting as a manager for the other jobs.  But you push that thought out of your mind.
  You want to stay professional at work.  Besides, you seriously doubt Olivia's master would give Andrew the key, even if Andrew wanted it.

  You work diligently at your new job, and decide that you made the right decision to not even ask about that.  It's best to keep your work
  life and your love life, or lack of it, separate.

<<nobr>>
  You also decide to work hard to keep [[any desires X-Change might have given you|Part5Olivia1]] from interfering with your job. Of course
  you can't help that your mind is always thinking about sex.  But if you stay busy it helps take your mind off of how horny you usually are.

  Each day your coach unlocks your belt for practice or to compete, but each day he has you lock it back on before you leave.  Thinking the belt was
  your idea, he says he understand your desire to keep yourself focused, body and mind, on your training. Usually you are too tired at the end of the
  day to think about sex anyway, but still your need builds a bit more each day.

  When your need overwhelms you, you begin to beg him to let you masturbate. He doesn’t, but he makes you an offer. You’ll need to train hard for
  the next several months. And then you’ll need to compete well at the big competition. If you do, then he’ll leave you alone in his office,
  unbelted, for a whole hour.

    <br><br>
    Though, more often you've fanasized about one of your fellow engineers in particular. Kyle leads some team working on a special project of
    some kind. He acts like it's something really important. The few other girls on the team don't seem to like him. Maybe their independent
    personalities just clash with leadership style, but it has the opposite effect on you. You find having someone like Kyle on the team, always
    willing to let you know the right way to do things, comforting and familiar.
  <<else>>
    You especially love to taunt Kyle.  He's leading a team on some special project, and always thinks he's better than everyone else.
    You like taking him down a notch sometimes.  "The only thing my 'rocker' is missing is something for my mouth.  It'd be great to have a
    nice, hard cock to wrap my lips around while I rode it."  When you see him shift uncomfortably as his erection strains against his jeans,

    After being on the team a while, you've started to have a problem. At first you were able to test the equipment pretty easily. The
    machines you designed to get a subject off, got you off. The ones you designed to tease and deny you, did exactly that. Or at least
    until it got to much and hopped off to masturbate, an option your poor test subjects don't have.
    <br><br>
    But recently, it's been getting harder and harder for you to orgasm. Even the machines designed to force multiple orgasms, rarely
    can get you to even one.
    <br><br>
    You really value Kyle's input, and hope that he might have some insights into the problem. You blush a bit, knowing how much he enjoys
    watching the recordings you made. You are fairly sure he'd eagerly accept an offer to [[supervise one of your sessions|JobEngineer3Kyle]]

      right track.
    <<else>>
      After a while though, it seems to get harder and harder to get off with some of the equipment - or even just masturbating.
      You make a visit to the health center, and after some tests they let you know that all of the masturbation you’ve been doing
      for work (and otherwise) has activated some latent side-effect of your X-Change. You can still orgasm as well as you could before,

  basic machine you have in the lab. Though, usually it is still very effective at getting any of the women that use it off. It also helps that
  it has a vibration only attachment that lets you use it while you still have your underwear on. You know it's silly, that Kyle has seen you

  You find a setting that feels good. You know a few weeks ago that it would have had you orgasming in no time. But today it feels good,
  but you can tell it's not going to get you off.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When Kyle touches you, to see if it helps, it's like electricity shooting pleasure through your body. Even him just stroking your hair makes
  the pleasure from the machine much more intense. It also makes you crave more. As you start sucking on his thumb he asks, "Would you like
  something more than my thumb?" You nod eagerly. "Say please," he tells you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Please, [[may I suck your cock|JobEngineer3Kyle2]]?" you say, hopefully.

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are nervous and shy when you first see Kyle's cock, but once you take it into your mouth, it feels so right. The taste of him on your tongue,
  the feel of his hardness between your lips, the soft moan he makes as you first take him into your mouth, you love all of it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You still don't think the machine would get you off, but you love everything you are feeling right now. You feel like you could ride the
  machine, with Kyle's cock in your mouth, all day. Though, you doubt Kyle would be able to last all day. Thinking of him orgasming for you
  makes you crave the taste of his cum, wondering what it will taste like.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Before that happens though, Kyle tells you. "I think I know what the problem is." He stops to moan. "You can hand me controls and
  I'll see if I'm right. Or..." He pauses to moan again.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You take his cock out of your mouth for a moment to say, "Does the other option involve [[you fucking me|JobEngineer3Kyle3]]?
  Because I need you inside me."
<</nobr>>

  <<set setup.addSex({name:'Kyle', sex:'male', vaginal:true, noPullout:true, noCondom:true})>>
  You are worried its going to hurt your first time, but it doesn't. It feels amazing from the first moment Kyle slides into you. You
  were already close, thanks to the machine. With Kyle's cock filling you, and with him looking down at you, telling you how beautiful you are and
  how good you feel, it pushes you over the edge.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <video src="Part3/JobEngineer11.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="540"></video>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You cry out with an orgasm, one that feels so much better than the ones you've given yourself with any of the machines. Kyle holds your legs
  in place though and continues fucking you. Each of this thrusts just keep your orgasm rolling over you. He doesn't last much longer than
  you did though. He soon pulls out and cums for you, covering your chest, and face, and stomach.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You feel a strange mixture of pride and shame as he cums on you, but mainly you still feel the warm pleasurable afterglow of your orgasm.
  You remember wondering what his cum tastes like so you get some on your finger and taste it. It tastes as good as you imagined it would earlier.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I didn't ask if you were on birth control, so..." he starts to say
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Oh, I am. You can come inside me next time if you want," you say eagerly.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He smiles at "next time", but says. "I'll need a few minutes first. Until then, I think I know the problem you've been having.  You'll
  need to go see the X-Change people to confirm though." He looks down at you and adds, "Not today though."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You and Kyle spend the rest of the day together, first at the lab, and then back at his apartment. The next day you stop by the X-Change office
  and they confirm what Kyle had suspected. Your implant has developed a delayed side effect. It seems that you can no longer get yourself off
  by masturbating, either by hand or with one of the machines, at least when you are controlling it.
  <br><br>
  They haven't fully figured out how your particular side effect works, but they tell you its mainly psychological. They think the machines in the
  lab might still be able to get you off, but just not with you controlling them yourself. You'll have to talk to Kyle about helping you test your
  creations then.

  The new equipment still needs to be tested. And instead of letting the other woman on the team get all the fun, you come up with
  another way. If you are locked in, and someone else is controlling the machine, it works fine on you.
<</nobr>>

  Your male coworkers soon find that you are quite horny and very willing to negotiate when you’re bound, helpless, and desperate for
  them to leave the machine on long enough to let you orgasm.  
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Kyle usually makes sure to be at the front of the line when he knows you are going to be helpless and willing to do anything.
  He's always more forceful than the other guys, more than happy to fuck your throat until you gag, or slap your tits or clit until
  you cry out in pain.  You'd regret teasing him as much you do, if you didn't love being treated like that when you are bound.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  And your fellow engineers also find you are even more willing to do what they want later, when you want them to turn off the machine after you cum.
  Though, after they've gotten off, sometimes they prefer to just watch you struggle for a while as you are forced to cum again and again.

  Of course it's not just the guys next door you are giving blowjobs to. Maybe it's the effects of your implant, maybe it's just being locked

  a little better, other than Kyle unlocking you, is to suck a cock.

<<nobr>>
  You'd felt bad about not contributing as much with new ideas in the lab as you did at first. You are just so much more distracted these days.
  It's not just because of the belt either. [[Trying to keep up with your classes|Part6StudyGroup]] is also more effort than it was earlier in the
  semester. But Kyle said the data you are helping them gather has been invaluable.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  They are getting closer with the feature you've been waiting for too. Now frequently in the lab they'll have you suck someone's cock. The
  first one is usually Kyle, but you usually take care of quite a few each time. But they've added another sensor to your belt. One that
  tracks how aroused you are, things like your wetness, your heart rate, temperature at various points on your body, and so on.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  During their testing in the lab, they also have a vibrator inside you! You'd love for them to just turn it up and let you cum as you suck
  their cocks. But they try to tune it to keep you as close to the edge as they can. Usually you are begging to cum before you've made
  it through half the team. After the other half is taken care of, they sometimes crank up the stimulation so you can come. Though sometimes
  you love frustrated, but eager for the next testing session.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Eventually the stimulation will be built right into the belt, and controlled automatically. You know with a feature like that, every girl
  wearing one of these is going to love sucking cock as much as you do. You just wish your belt had that stimulation built into it already.
