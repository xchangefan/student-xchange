	<h1>Job/Activity Fair</h1>
	Welcome back ladies. I hope everyone had a good first day in their new bodies.  I hope everyone took the time to get to know your mentors a bit better as well.
	Most of you probably hit it off right away.  Although, for some of you, it might take a while for you to grow on each other.
	But if you have any difficulties, remember, your mentor is only trying to look out for you, as best she sees how.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	I can see you all had fun on your shopping trips yesterday as well.  The first shopping trip was on us.  But you'll need some money of your own for the next one.
	Which brings us to today's event.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	We’ve lined up several local employers with job openings that some of you may qualify for. These include both on and off campus employers.

<</nobr>>

<<print "There are also some representatives from the athletic department here as well. Those positions aren’t technically allowed to pay you. But they do offer scholarships that would cover some of your tuition. That means you’d get to keep some of the money X-Change would have paid to the school. So it works out about the same as if they did pay you.">>

<<print "Before you head out to the fair, talk to your mentor. She may have another job for you to think about while you’re looking over your other options.">>

<<print "But keep in mind the choice is yours. Well, yours and the employers. Your mentor is just giving you another option to choose from.">>

				I looked through the jobs out there. Most of them look ok, I guess, but some of them... well, I just hope their parents
				don’t learn how they earn their money.  I’m glad my parents give me enough I don’t have to worry about a job at school.
				I hope I still meet my future husband while I’m here, and I never have to work outside the home. But I guess that’s not
				an option for you yet, so I’ll try to help out."<br>

				Anyway, I know this guy, Andrew, who’d be perfect for you. To hire you I mean. He’s here working on his business degree, but he also
				manages the coffee shop on campus. His dad actually owns the whole chain of stores. Andrew will be running it all in a few years.
				Most girls think he’s handsome too. I’m sure he’ll make someone a wonderful husband some day.
				<br><br>
				Why don’t I set you two up for a dat... a dinner meeting. So he can get to know you and see about a job for you.
				Even if he doesn’t have a job, I’m sure you’ll have a great time. One of the dresses we bought earlier will be perfect for
				your... meeting.

			I didn’t know of any jobs to recommend for you so I asked my boyfriend about it and he had an idea. His brother is a manager at an office
			that’s not to far from campus. Their receptionist quit not to long ago, and they are looking for a new one. He said he could put in a good

			No, I wouldn’t use the word ‘prostitute’ that sounds like a street walker or something. I prefer ‘call girl’.  I use this service, I
			just tell them when  I want to work, and they give me a text with the address I’m supposed to go to. I can make as much in a night as
			most of those jobs pay in a week or more.

			<</link>>:
			Some of those jobs in the booths look ok, but I have another option for you.
			My favorite bar is looking for a new bartender. Looking like you do, it won’t matter if you don’t have any prior experience.
			As long as you don’t mind a bunch of horny, half-drunk women flirting with you, you can pick up the rest on the job.<br>
			<img src="Part2/Samantha1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="550"><img src="Part3/JobSamantha.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="550"><br>
			And if you do a little flirting back at them, you’ll be going home with lots of tips every night. *Who* you go home with is entirely up to you, of course.
			<br><br>
			And don’t worry about your age. As long as you keep the girls buying drinks, the boss isn’t going to care.
			After you look around, let me know if you are interested.

			I wanted to let you know about two things before you started looking.
			<br><br>
			First, my master owns an adult toy and clothing store. It’s the one we got your chastity belt from in fact.<br>

			He’s looking for another model for their website. You’ll get to dress, or wear, or use many of the things they sell there. And you’ll get to
			work with me, as I’m their other model! Plus we get to keep a lot of what we model too!
			<br><br>
			The other thing is, master didn’t want you to feel pressured to take the job. He said to take it only if you wanted it. You can also decide to only

				<<set $JobSide = 1>>
				<<goto [[JobList2]]>>
			<</link>>
			<br><br>
			If you take a different job, he’ll make sure your boss will have a copy of your belt’s key. That way they’ll be able to take it off if you need to
			be unbelted for practice, or work, ... or whatever.  He’ll just make them promise to make sure it’s back on when you leave.  Let me know what you
			decide on.

<<print "The studio decides to give your fans what they want, proof that you are a slut. They film a special video at the start of the next phase of your career.">>

<<print "You are a bit disapointed when you are told that it is going to be just a solo shoot today. It starts normally with you getting fucked in the ass until you orgasm.">>

<<print "As you recover and the guy resumes fucking your ass, you are surprised to see 3 more guys entering the room, ready to fuck you in all your holes.">>

<<print "You are so excited and happy by this turn of events, but you cannot help but genuinely smile.">>

<<print "The pleasure your X-Change gives you when you get fucked in all your holes feels so exquisite, so each day you are more horny than the last, and more eager for the next cock to suck or fuck.">>

<<print "Your fans are always excited when they see you in public, They know all they need to do is ask, and you’ll soon be somewhere nearby with your lips around their cock (or, occasionally, your tongue flicking across their clit), or maybe you would even let them fuck you.">>

<<print "And you have a large and increasing number of fans on campus.">>
