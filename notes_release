------------------------
Changes made in Part 15.0.1
- Added additional text so new players have a better idea how your father will react if you tell him at the beginning
- Preference selection, when one can pick a name. As soon as one hits the 'r' key, the next page appears, rather than being able to write out the name. A hotkey getting priority where it shouldn't, I imagine.
- Removed non-existant generic "Prison" achievement from ending list - this was left over from before multiple prison endings were added.
- Eliminated bug treating Bailey like a boyfriend if you become permanently chaste.  Now leads to an alternate ending if you were dating Bailey.
- Fixed handling of 2nd year Halloween, and you are dating someone while in chastity
- Fixed html tag errors on Part14IslandMassage
- Fixed bad evaluation message on Divorce4
- Eliminated period messages if you are on the 'perfect' implant birth control
- Fixed problem with neighbour/roommate displaying as variable on second belt penetration test
- Fixed message about knowing about pregnancy already on Part10StripPregnant
- Fixed conflict with Eric engineering scene if you already are dating someone
- Tweaking pretrial/trial to make not guilty verdict easier to obtain
- Added chance to misbehave while waiting to testify, and tweaking guilty/not guilty chance as a witness
- Fixed conflict when starting to date Veronica at sorority when already dating Peter
- Fixed variable on JobPornOral1
- Fixed variable on Part15HalloweenBaileyLeftLesbian and Part15HalloweenBaileyLeft
- Tweaking script handling of repeat sex encoutners to speed up some page load times
- Removed submissive/cat-girl variation from kidnapping ending.  Expanded cat-girl variation of reeducation ending.
- Tweaking birth control effectiveness when used (condoms, withdrawal, pills/pill-implant), no change to when specifically not used
- Added option to temporarily use condoms if notice ovulating at Halloween
- Additional backstory on Freedonia and options for family visit
- Removed "Gold Star Lesbian" achievement as it is not yet achievable (it would be awarded at an ending where you only have sex with women, but there aren't any qualifying endings yet).  The image remains and the achievement will be added back later, but removing it from the list of achivements so the X of X count on the achievement page doesn't reflect this one yet.
- Removed "Student life balance" text from sidebar as it was confusing and not useful
- Fixed where Part13Barry scene didn't handle if you were in Chastity
- Fixed logic when texting boyfriend/girlfriend over christmas break first year
- Fixed logic at Valentine's Day when dating Kate and have Call Girl side-job
