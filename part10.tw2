    It’s the start of February, and you realize Peter hasn't came since you started dating Aaron, last semester.
    Daddy still has the 'look but don't touch' rule for Peter.  Peter's not allowed to touch you at all, though the rule
    has been relaxed a bit for you.
    <br><br>
    Daddy said you should reward Peter for all the tutoring and other help he gives you.  So once a month, you
    cuff Peter's hands and tease his cock for a while.  Usually you tell Peter about what it feels like as
    Daddy fucks you, and tell Peter to imagine what it must feel like for Aaron when he does.  Of course, you
    always stop before Peter has a chance to cum.  Then you tell him to imagine what it feels like for Aaron
    when he keeps going and cums for you.
    <br><br>
    Daddy wouldn't mind if you let Peter orgasm, you just stop because you want to.
    But based on how well you did last semester, with Peter's help, and to reward him for his own straight-A's
    as well, Daddy said you should give him a special reward.  "How special?", you ask, hoping Daddy isn't
    suggesting what you think he is.
    <br><br>
    "Don't worry, I didn't mean that special, naughty girl," he says before giving your bare bottom a playful smack.
    "Maybe a little relief though."
    <br><br>
    When Peter's next tease session arrives, he's disappointed at first that he won't feel your hands on his cock this time.
    The gag you put on him quickly silences his whining, though it would have stopped as soon as he felt the vibrations on
    his cock anyway.  He's desperate to get as much stimulation from the wand as he can, he doesn't know you plan on
    letting him cum today, and thinks you might turn off the wand at any time.
    <br><br>
    Only after he's covered himself in his own cum, and maneuvered his sensitive cock away from the wand do you turn it off.
    You leave him there a while longer, until the cum on his stomach, legs, and chest has dried.
    <br><br>
    "Thank you for your help last semester, and this semester too," you tell him as you put his cock back in it's cage.
    "I want you to remember how grateful and generous I am, so you aren't allowed to wash this mess off until tomorrow morning."
    <br><br>
    "Mes, msstrss", he mumbles into his gag.

  used for their pleasure, with no regard for your own, is also a big turn on for you too.

  "Very well," Kate tells you.  "You can be three holes for them to use how they like, if that's what you want.  But

    You are trying not to have sex, or think about sex, or anything like that anyway. Obviously working in sex shop isn't going to help
    with the not thinking about it part. But wearing a chastity belt will help make sure you don't do anything you shouldn't in a moment
    of weakness.
    <br><br>
    But, as you glance over at a rack of vibrators, you realize it will also prevent you from masturbating.  At least not without a very
    awkward conversation with your boss first to get him to unlock you, if he will.  Hopefully $Roommate won't be home this evening.
    You'll at least see about getting a few orgasms in before you start work in a couple days.
  <<else>>
    He says you won’t be starting work for a couple days, so you are planning on spending that time
    <<if $PlayerSideEffectMasturbationBlock>>
      fucking like crazy.
    <<else>>
      fucking and masturbating as much as you can.
    <</if>>

<<nobr>>
  But then he tells you you’ll need to put the belt on now, before you leave.
  <<if $PlayerPregnant>>
    You try to get out of it by telling him you're pregnant, but he says not to worry.  He'll have the fit adjusted on a regular basis, and make
    sure your obstetrician's office has a key for emergencies and exams.
  <</if>>
  He's offering you a cash advance before you start the job and he want's to be sure you actually show up.  The cash advance
  he offers you will really come in handy, so you agree to it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  As Olivia begins to fit the belt on to you for him, your heart starts to race.  When she finally
  clicks the lock closed you realize you are at his mercy now.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You aren’t sure how legal the contract you signed is, but it said that he’d decide when the
  belt came off as long as you worked here.  And even if you quit, it wouldn’t come off until
  you paid back any advances he's given you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It’s only a couple days before you start work, but by the time you do, you are much hornier
  than you imagined you would be.  It’s not even the lack of sex or masturbating, but the
  thought of knowing that you can’t, that is [[driving you insane|Part10WebModel5]].

  You’re expecting to be working behind the counter, but you find out that is Olivia’s job.  Your
  job is cleaning out the booths.  The back of the store has video booths where guys go to watch
  porn and jerk off.  You wonder why they don’t just do it at home for free like normal people,
  but it doesn’t matter.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  As you start cleaning the disgusting mess in one of the booths, you think about how little
  you are getting paid for this, especially with part of your pay going to pay back the
  <<if $Mentor == 'Olivia'>>
    advance.
  <<else>>
     advance and part going to pay for the cost of the belt.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  While you are lost in thought, you notice a hole in the wall between the booths and
  absentmindedly peek through it.  In the dim light from the screen you can make out some guy
  starting to stroke himself.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You reach down, wishing you could give yourself some pleasure too, but remember you
  can’t.  You look away, and get back to work.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  A moment later you see a couple fingers holding some cash poke through the hole. You
  take the generous tip and look at it.  It’s not much, but you figure ever bit helps. But then
  a moment later the fingers are replaced as a cock appears through the hole.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Maybe your horniness is clouding your judgement, but you look at the money in your
  hand, and back at the cock.  Then you then drop to your knees and get to work.  You
  figure at least there won’t be any mess in the booth to clean up this time.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Before long he is moaning and filling you mouth with cum.  You realize that if you spit it out, it just be one
  more mess you'd have to clean up, so you swallow it down.  After a moment, you brush yourself off and head
  [[back to the front of the store|Part10WebModel6]].
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    You've tasted cum before, but only just a little bit, and only your own back before you changed.  This tastes so much better.
    You don't know if it's because of changes to your body the X-Change implant made, or just because this guy's cum tastes better
    than your old body's did.  You figure you'll find out when you can compare it to the next guy's taste.
    <br><br>
    How casually that thought springs it your head shocks you.
    <<if setup.sexVaginalCount() == 0>>
      You are still a virgin,
    <<else>>
      You are trying to be a good girl,
    <</if>>
    but you just dropped to your knees to suck some anonymous guy's cock, and are already imagining the next one.  You would be ashamed
    about doing it for the small tip he gave, but you know you would have wrapped your lips around it just the same even if he hadn't dropped
    a few bills through the hole first.
    <br><br>
    You hadn't thought wearing the belt would be a big deal, but now you wish so bad that you weren't in it.  You ache to be filled, and
    regret the time you wasted avoiding it the first half of the year.  You know as soon as you have a chance, outside of this belt, you
    are going to try to make up for the fun you've been missing.
    <br><br>
    Until then, you'll have to settle for the smaller pleasure of feeling a hard cock between your lips and on your tongue, hearing him
    moan for you, and tasting him as his cum fills your mouth.  You sigh as your hand absentmindedly reaches between your legs as you think
    about it, and finds the hard metal of your belt.

  so nervous and will probably be buying them from you [[every time he comes in|Part10StripPeterRegular2]].

  Once you start grinding against him, you notice there’s something different about the bulge in his pants
  and you think you know what it is.  You nibble on his ear and whisper, "Do you have the key with you?".
  He doesn't answer, but the look on his face confirms your suspicion.  After he’s paid you for several
  more dances you say goodbye. Then you breathe onto his ear as you whisper, "and bring the key next time."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  On his next visit, you have him take off the cage for his private dance.  As his you feel his erection
  you wonder how long it’s been since he’s allowed himself to get hard.  You know you could probably get
  him off just from grinding hard enough against his pants.  You don’t.  But you do make sure to keep him
  close through most of the dance.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When your time together is over, you leave him alone so he can get soft enough to put his cage back on. 
  Meanwhile you make a quick trip to your locker.  When you return, you click his lock shut on his cage.
  You hold out your hand until he nervously hands over his key.  Then you smile and attach the numbered
  plastic seal you’d purchased after his last visit to the cage also. "Just in case you have a back-up
  key.  Now I'll know for sure that you haven't taken it off."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "If you come back next week and that’s still on there, maybe I’ll let you cum that time."

    After you are done with his dance, you [[head back out|Part10StripVeronica]] to continue your

  You do most of his teasing at home, in private, but sometimes you tell him to come to work and watch
  you dance.  You always make sure to give him a good show.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Your favorite part though is when you lead some uncaged guy with a handful of cash off to for a private dance
  <<if !setup.areDating('Veronica')>>
    or a trip to the VIP room
  <</if>>
  . The way Peter bites his lip, imagining that guy was him, always gets you wet.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You love watching Peter walk out when you are done teasing him.  You know his mind is flooded with
  thoughts of you naked.  You know that his hand would be around his cock as soon as he got home,
  if he could wait that long.  You smile knowing he can't, not until you allow it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't worry about him too long though.  There's a room full of horny guys with full wallets,
  <<if setup.areDating('Veronica')>>
    and you need to get [[back to work|Part10StripVeronica]].
  <<else>>
    and you going to make sure at least one of those isn't still true when they leave here tonight.

  When you spot Peter at the stage watching you, you smile seductively and crawl across the
  stage towards him. The club isn’t crowded yet, so you spend most of your set entertaining
  him.  When you are done on stage, you grab his hand, and lead him back to the private area.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He seems nervous, but you try to reassure him.  "Don’t worry, I’ll be gentle... probably.
  And I’m giving you the [[first one for free|Part10StripPeterNeighbour2]]

  Once you start grinding against him, you notice there’s something different about the bulge
  in his pants and you’re pretty sure you know what it is.  You smile and unzip his pants.
  You soon reveal his caged cock, desperately trying to get hard in its metal prison.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You sit on his laps with your legs on either side of him, his caged cock pressed against you.
  Then you nibble on his ear and whisper, "do you have the key with you?".  "N....no," he
  struggles to say.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Aww, don’t look so disappointed.  I wasn’t going to let you out.  I was going to keep it.
  You’ll just have to give it to me when we get home then."  Once he agrees, then you continue
  dancing for him.  "Actually, I’ll pick up my own lock on the way home instead," you tell him,
  "just in case you have another key."
  <<if setup.isEx('Peter')>>
    <br><br>
    "But don't get the wrong idea," you tell him.  "We aren't a couple again.  I'm just holding your key
    because we both know you don't deserve to have it yourself."
    <br><br>
    "Yes, ma'am," he says obediently.

    While Peter can only think about when he'll be able to cum again, you have something

  You weren’t sure how Veronica would feel about your new job, so you told her to come visit
  you at work.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Once she was there though, you could tell it was going to be fine.  You could see how
  much watching you, and the other girls, on stage was turning her on.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When she was watching you, you pulled her up on stage with you, and started making
  out with her as you pulled off bits of her clothes.  She loved the thrill of it.

<<nobr>>
  Now, she works with you at the club.  Usually you are on separate stages, but you love

  Or when a husband and wife come in.  You and Veronica can spot the bicurious wife right away.
  You offer them a 2-for-1 lap dance with one of you dancing for her husband and the other for her.
  The wife always agrees even before the husband can.  Of course the husband has to go home alone
  while his wife heads home with you and Veronica.  But he’ll get to hear all about her exciting
  night the next day.
