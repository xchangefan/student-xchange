I'll still need to a more detailed guide eventually, but here's some quick pointers to getting the remaining endings:

There are two that you can end up with if you go to the island resort with Barry over the summer and decide to stay.  (One if you have the fertility side effect,
and another if you don't)

There is another that you can get if you have Emily as your mentor, take the office job, and start dating your boss, then get him to leave his wife.
(You don't want to get pregnant first semester, or abort if you do.)

There is an ending you can get if you 1) have the no masturbation or denial side effects, choose "trying to get pregnant", get pregnant first
semester and decide to carry it to term, and end up on academic probation both semesters.

There is an ending over the summer that you can get if Olivia was your mentor, and you submit to her master.  You have to have fooled
around with your former uncle over Christmas, or with Dylan over the summer.

There is a similar, but slight different ending with Andrew if you don't get pregnant first semester, but do second semester.
Then you decide you decide you want a small family, not a large one.

Most of the achievements you'll end up getting if you have all the endings.  The ones you might not are:

"Underdog".  For that you need to win the 'hunt' on the island even though you were caught once (or be plus sized which also makes it harder.).

"Sisters" you get this if Dylan tries X-Change and you, him, and your sister hang out.  I think this can happen if you work at the lesbian bar (job Samantha
gets for you)

"Beginner's Luck" if you did say you are trying to get pregnant, but then end up getting pregnant from your first time having sex.  There is a random
factor to this one.  No birth control at all and then staying a virgin to Halloween I think works the best.
(Currently it 'decides' if you got pregnant just before the test at the clinic, so if you don't get it, you can back up a couple screens and try again)

finally, "Reuniting with Old Friends" is if you are hanging out with your old friends over the summer and then end up having sex with them.  You need
to not be in a relationship for this to a possibility.  (Being a virgin, and getting on academic probation both semesters is one way to trigger it also)
