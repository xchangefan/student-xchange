		As soon as Emily hears her boyfriend come in, she excitedly leads you next door to meet him and your other neighbor.

			<<case "Emily's Boyfriend">>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2F.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br/>
				You try to talk with Emily‘s boyfriend, but she keeps all his attention for herself.  He seems normal though.
				And it gives you more time to get to know your other neighbor.
			<<case 'Barry'>>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2A.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br/>
				On the plus side, you can tell Barry thinks of you the same as he does any other woman.  Though you can quickly tell in his case that might not be such a good
				thing. He doesn't seem to think much of women in general, and of you in particular.  You get the impression he's only interested in one thing from you and the
				other women on campus, and it's not your opinions.
				<br><br>
				"I know a lot of girls like to slut it up their first semester.  Feel free to stop by anytime and I'll give you what you need.  Or at least what you deserve,"
				he tells you.
				<<if $Mentor == "Olivia">>
					"Unless all your best parts are locked away like they are for your roommate that is," he adds.
					<<if $PlayerChastityBelt>>
						"Ha! I take it from that face you just made you're wearing one too.  Well, I still love blowjobs so the offer still stands.  I'll get my dick sucked, and I
						won't have to hear you talk - that sounds twice as good."
					<</if>>
				<</if>>
			<<case 'James'>>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2B.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br>
				<<if $Mentor == "Hannah">>
					When Hannah sees James she tells you, "Yeah, that is the guy I was thinking off.  He's a fun time if you ever get bored."
					Then she holds her hands an impressive number of inches apart and gives you a thumbs up sign.  James notices the gesture and flashes a smile at you.
					<br><br>
				<</if>>
				As you talk to James he seems quite charming, and says all the right things and you feel like you could just keep talking to him.
				Later, $Mentor warns you,
				<<if $Mentor == "Hannah">>
					"If you're looking for a commitment, you'll probably want to look somewhere where else.  But if you are just looking for good time, he'll give you one."
				<<else>>
					"I've seen guys like him before.  He'll charm the pants off a girl like you and quickly move on to the next one."
					<<if $Mentor != "Faith">>
						Of course, if that's what you want too, it'll probably be a good time while it lasts.
					<</if>>
				<</if>>
			<<case 'Peter'>>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2C.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br>
				Peter seems quite shy, especially when he's talking to you.
				<<if $Mentor == "Faith">>
					He seemed more talkative with Faith though.  She tells you later "Don't worry, he'll open up.  Peter's always nervous around girls he's just met,
					especially the pretty ones.  He must really like you."
				<<else>>
					He seems sweet, but you seem to really make him nervous.  He seems a little less nervous talking to $Mentor.  You wonder if it's because he finds you attractive.
				<</if>>
				<br><br>
				Part of you wonders what kind of a boyfriend Peter would make if you could get him to come out of his shell a bit.
			<<case 'Zack'>>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2D.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br>
				<<if $Mentor == "Samantha">>
					"How have you been?", Zack says when he sees Sam walk in.  "I haven't seen you in a while, are you still jumping?"<br><br>
					"No, Beth was the adventurous one, I'm happy keeping both feet on the ground now," Sam replies before gesturing towards you,
					"I think my roommate here is looking to try new things, so she might be interested."<br><br>
				<</if>>
				As you to talk to Zack you can tell he lives for adventure.  Rock climbing, skydiving, you-name-it, he loves anything that gets the adrenaline going.
				He makes it sounds fun too, he's already talked you into giving skydiving a try - just once to see if you like it.
			<<case 'Josh'>>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2E.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br>
				Josh seems like a typical 18 year old guy, a bit immature, but friendly and polite.  If you were still a guy, and he was your roommate, you're guessing
				you would be come good friends.
				<br><br>
				As you get to know him more you find out he’s the first in his family to go to college. He’s excited, and nervous about it all,
				and wants to make the best of it.

  You talk to Kyle about how you feel. He's not surprised that you are horny all the time, he was already aware of that, and that you
  couldn't take care of it yourself. He'd just been assuming you were fucking whoever you could whenever you felt the need. When he
  found out you were only having sex with him, he was very happy.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He'd just been thinking of you as a 'friend with benefits', and you suppose that's what you were. But you were hoping to be more. Partly
  because you don't want to be as promiscuous as your father expected you to become. But more because you are starting to develop feelings
  for him. By the end of your conversation you and him are officially dating. Though you both still have a 'pass' for anything sexual that
  you might need to do for the lab, otherwise you plan on being faithful to each other.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You explain to him that it's a constant struggle for you, especially when you wake up in the morning horny and with two guys right next door.
  Kyle said you can stay over at his room most nights until he works something else out. You like that much better. His roommate has walked
  in you guys a few times, and has seen you naked more than once. But he didn't seem to mind.

  You aren't sure what the [[other solution|Part5Faith4Kyle]] he was talking about until then, but he did ask if you'd mind transferring to his

  After talking with you about it, Kyle gets approval to have you transferred to his team. After signing an even more strict non-disclosure

  It's not just any chastity belt though. This one will be smart. It will be able to tease or give orgasms. Reward or punish you, and many

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But Kyle has gotten approval to have you wear-test some of the different belt designs they are working on. Yours will just be a regular
  belt, without any electronics, at least for now. You'll just be seeing how comfortable they are, if it's possible to 'work around' the
  belt, that sort of thing.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Kyle makes it clear that you're on the team, as an engineer, either way. The belt is just an option to help with the issues you've been
  complaining about. You eagerly tell him you love the idea. As long as he's going to have the key, you'd love to wear one of the belt
  mock-ups. They fit you with one and lock it on you. They even take a few photos that they might use in some of the documentation.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Kyle says they might switch out the belts from time to time. There's a few different designs they are working on. And they might add
  some of the extra functionality eventually too later. You are excited to find out more about the features they are working on, and see if
  you are able to contribute any suggestions of your own.

  With some of the more streamlined belts, most of your clothes still work. Even with tight fitting shorts,
  it's hard to tell you are wearing one of the low-profile belts. Panties are rather pointless now for you, and don't really
  fit over the belt, at least not without going up several sizes.

<<nobr>>
  You've definitely noticed the big downside to "closed-rear" belts. Going to the bathroom is quite a challenge. If the rear chain is lose
  or flexible enough, you have to pull it to the side when you go #2, which is annoying. Or if it's not movable, then you just have to go
  with in on, letting it break things in half as you go, and then clean up afterwards. And that's much worse.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Though if Kyle and you are going to be together, he just unlocks you when you need to go. That's fine for the two of you, and he
  sometimes has a bit of extra fun with it too. But that's not going to work when the belt is released and intended for more continuous wear.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You've let the team know that personally, you don't mind having to change your wardrobe a bit, even if some of the skirts Kyle picked out
  are shorter than what you would have bought for yourself. You let your coworkers know that while it's not a sexy feature, being able to
  easily and cleanly use the bathroom is something the wearer will certainly want.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Though, to your embarrassment, Kyle also went into detail on [[some of the benefits|Part5Faith6Kyle]] of the open-rear design for her

  Kyle went into detail with the team on how much you love anal sex, and how your preferred belt design-type lets the two of you have it
  without ever taking the belt off. He mentions that while you are predisposed to enjoy it thanks to the effects of your implant, he suspects
  most women would probably come to crave it as much as you do after a while in a belt. And that would certainly be the case if they added a
  feature to the belt that 'encouraged' the wearer during anal.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He tells them, that you were shy and a bit ashamed about anal at first. But now you'll climb onto his cock whenever you can and ride him
  until he cums. He also tells them how occasionally you can even cum from anal, though usually it's with him in control.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "We may want to detect when an orgasm is about to happen in case we want to prevent it...," he starts to talk about some future features. But
  you've stopped paying attention, and are instead imagining Kyle inside your ass again.

      <ul>
        <li>Imagining that makes you even more early suck his cock. <i>Yes! That would be wonderful!</i></li>
        <li><i>The need you feel overwhelms you and you beg, "Please, I need you inside me."</i>
        He gently pushes your head back towards his cock and you stop talking and quickly wrap your lips around again and resume.</li>

    <li>"And what if your belt kept you on the edge of an orgasm, until you gave me mine?"</li>

	people have chosen to wait longer.  There's nothing wrong with that per se.  It's when it leads to premarital promiscuity, as it so often
	does, that it becomes troubling.  The fact that you are here seeking help to avoid that is a good sign."

	The two of you set up a time to [[come back and discuss the situation further|Part5Faith9]] with him later in the week.

	<h1>Making a plan</h1>
<</nobr>>

<video src="Part5/Faith11.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="540"></video>

<<nobr>>
	Pastor Mark has had more time to think about your situation.  "I think you need to act soon.  I can tell your resistance to your desires is starting
	to weaken.  I fear you may decide to give in to them.  And after you did once, I doubt you would hesitate to do so again.  I expect you would sprial
	out of control soon after that. Can you imagine what you might do if that happened?  Sorry, that was a poor choice of words.  Don't actually try to
	imagine that."
<</nobr>>
	
<<nobr>>
	The first thing he wants to try is to give you something else to do to take your mind off of your desires.  "Most of the activities available on
	campus would just put you in more situations that would tempt you to sin.  I'm sure promiscuity and licentious behavior are problems at most campuses,
	but it seems much worse here for some reason."  Faith has told him about how you'd wanted to learn the play the guitar, but had never learned.  He
	offers to teach you, and then you can play at ministry events eventually.  That'll keep you away from temptation as much as possible.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	You can tell him: "That's a wonderful idea.  I need to [[try something|Part5Faith10]]." Or, you could tell him: "Thank you for trying to help me,
	but I don't think the campus ministry is for me.  I'll learn to [[manage my desires on my own|Part5FaithNo]]."

<</nobr>>

<video src="Part5/Faith13.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="540"></video>

<<nobr>>
	You want no part of Faith and Mark's plans for you.  They didn't even what you to masturbate!  It certainly wasn't the X-Change that made you like
	that.  And the thought of spending hours learning to play boring church songs on a guitar sounded like torture.  They are disappointed when you
	let them know you are not interested.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	On the way home, you stop the sex shop in town to pick up a dildo.  You see one of the other mentors, Olivia, working there.  She seems much less uptight
	than Faith.  You wonder how much more fun you would have been having if she had been your mentor instead.  She recognizes you as well and gives
	you her employee discount and tells you to have fun with your new toy.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	Thankfully, Faith is at the ministry frequently, so you don't have to wait long until you have the room to yourself.  You suck on your new toy
	as you other hand finds its way to your clit.  Once you've gotten yourself wet and can't wait any longer, you
	<<if $PlaySideEffectOral>>reluctantly<</if>> pull the dildo out of your mouth.  You moan as it feels so good sliding in.  
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	<<if $PlayerSideEffectMasturbationBlock>>
		"Why have I been denying myself this?", you wonder.  But as you keep going instead of it feeling better and better, you start to feel it less and less.
		You pick up the pace and go deeper with the dildo, and try rubbing your clit, but it doesn't help. Even as the feelings diminish, your hunger for some
		release goes up and up.
		<br><br>
		You eventually give up, realizing it's the masturbation denial side effect they'd told you about causing this.  By the time you stop, you are feeling almost
		nothing, but far hornier than when you'd started.  You are tempted to go out and find some guy, right now!  But you manage to summon up just enough willpower
		to throw the dildo in your drawer and try to get some sleep.  Maybe you can [[figure out something on Sunday|Part5FaithNo2]] when Faith will be gone all
		morning.
	<<elseif $PlayerSideEffectOrgasmBlock>>
		"Why have I been denying myself this?", you wonder.  You keep going as you feel your orgasm build and build...
		"No!!!", you cry out as you suddenly feel your orgasm slip away just before you can cum.  You realize your implant's side effect has denied
		your orgasm.  You'd try again, but you know the result will be the same for at least the next day.  You toss the dildo into a drawer and
		try to tell yourself, "Well, at least it felt good while it lasted."  You figure you'll [[try again on Sunday|Part5FaithNo2]] when
		Faith will be gone all morning.
	<<else>>

	<<if $PlayerSideEffectOrgasmBlock or $PlayerSideEffectMasturbationBlock>>
		when you are leaving your yoga class at the fitness center.  You were hoping the class would take your mind off the frustration you've
		been feeling, but it didn't.  As you are walking through the center, you see the basketball team practicing and sit down in the front row
		of the empty bleachers to watch.
		<br><br>
		You don't even realize how much you've been staring until after they are done and one of the players comes over to talk to you.  He
		noticed how you were looking at him while he practiced.  He says he's about to head to the shower, but wants to know if you'd like to
		join him for coffee after he's done.
		<br><br>
		"How about we just go back to your room, right now instead?", you ask.  He doesn't take any convincing and decides to leave his other
		clothes in the locker room to pick up later and heads straight to his room with you.
		<br><br>
		As soon as you feel his cock slide into you, you've know you'd made the right decision.  You don't know why you ever tried to avoid this.
		As you get closer you worry that you'll be denied again, either by your implant, or by him cumming too soon.  But thankfully, neither
		is the case this time.
		<br><br>
		After you both have came, you lie next to him for a while.  It's been so long since you had an orgasm.  You hope you never have to go that
		long again.
		<<if $PlayerSideEffectOrgasmBlock>>But unless your implant thwarts you again, you shouldn't have to wait very long until your next one.<</if>>
		After you've given him a bit of time to recover, you take his cock into your mouth and begin to coax it back to life for another round.
	<<elseif $JobAthlete>>
		when your sore muscles lead you to the massage area at the athletic center.  You tell yourself you are just getting a massage, but you
		knew that wasn't true when you walked in.  Why else would you have specifically requested one of the guys for your massage?  Even when
		his hands are just oiling up your stomach and legs, your body tells you that you've made the right decision.  You've denied it for far
		too long.
		<br><br>
		He sees your reactions and knows you want more.  You would have thought your smile as his hands slide up your thigh and part your legs
		would be enough to confirm it for him.  But as his deft fingers tease the outside of your lips and slide across your clit he asks,
		"Do you want me to continue?"
		<br><br>
		"Not with your hands," you answer as you pull the draw string to untie his pants.
		<br><br>
		After you've both came, he returns to your actual massage for a while, until he's ready for another round.
	<<else>>
		when you are leaving class.  You'd known he'd had a crush on you since the beginning of the semester, but you hadn't been interested in him.
		Today he'd finally worked up the nerve to ask you out on a date.  You still aren't interested in him, but you have a need that you've been
		ignoring for too long, and you know he'd be more than willing to help you with it.  You tell him you aren't interested in a date, but that
		you have something better he can help you with, right now.
		<br><br>
		He doesn't seem to mind you rejecting his date offer as you pull him into an empty study room near your class room.  It isn't long until your
		skirt is up and your panties are down and his cock is sliding into you.  As you get close to cumming, he reaches a hand around to cover your mouth
		so no one hears the moans coming from the 'quiet' study room.  His hand over your mouth pushes you over the top and you are soon screaming into his
		hand as you orgasm.  That's enough to push him over the top too as he thrusts a final time and cums inside you. 		
		<br><br>
		As you straighten yourself back up and start to head out of the room, you tell him this is just a one time thing, and he's fine with that.  But you
		also realize you'll be in the same class with him the rest of the semester, and you're sure he'll be ready for another trip to the study room if
		you ever need it again.

	All you have to do is just squeeze a bit tighter and stroke a bit deeper, to make sure the other one ‘loses’.
	As his cum covers your hand, you are sure he's never had more fun losing before in his life.  You take your winner back to your room.
	You plan on having him eat you out long enough that you are close to an orgasm, and so that the one he was holding back will have faded,
	before you'll let him	finally start to fuck you.

	You and $neighbours[$tempStrokeWinner] are barely in your room when Hannah walks in. Her date didn’t go well so she ended it when she saw your text.
	“I saw your text and figured I’d take whichever guy you didn’t.”, she says, “But now that I see how horny and frustrated you have this one already,
	I want to play too.”’You tell her you’d be happy to share.

	You and her have hours of fun with $neighbours[$tempStrokeWinner]. You take turns, one rides his face while the other teases his cock.
	You and Hannah have came many times, but you make sure to keep him on the edge of an orgasm, but never let him cum. As he’s eating Hannah out for
	the final time he begs for you to let him cum this time.

	This final time instead of teasing him again, you climb on top of him. You’re sure <<print $neighbours[(1-$tempStrokeWinner)]>> next door hears the
	moan $neighbours[$tempStrokeWinner] makes as you slide his cock inside you.  You grind slowly, teasing him inside you, until after he gets Hannah off
	again. When she’s satisfied, then you begin riding him in earnest. He doesn’t last very long after that.
