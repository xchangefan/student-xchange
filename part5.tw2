	<<if $Mentor == 'Olivia'>>
		I've... ummm... met Barry before actually.  I like it when guys put me in my place, and Barry is good at that.  But I know some other girls don't like him at all.
	<<else>>
		One of the other mentors knew him.  She seemed to like him, but from the way she described him, he sounded like a bit of
		<<if $Mentor == 'Faith'>>
			a jerk.
		<<else>>
			an ass.
		<</if>>
	<</if>>
	But it's your choice.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	<<link "James">><<set setup.addNeighbour("James")>><<goto [[NeighbourAssign]]>><</link>>:
	<<if $Mentor == 'Hannah'>>
		I think I hooked up with him once.  It was just a fun, one-time thing, so don't let that discourage you if you're interested.
	<<else>>
		A couple of the girls I talked with
		<<if $Mentor == 'Faith'>>
			have... ummm... dated James.  But he doesn't really seem like 'future husband' material to me.
		<<else>>
			have fooled around with James.  They all sounded like they had a good time though.

<<nobr>>
	<<link "Josh">><<set setup.addNeighbour("Josh")>><<goto [[NeighbourAssign]]>><</link>>:

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	<<link "Peter">><<set setup.addNeighbour("Peter")>><<goto [[NeighbourAssign]]>><</link>>:
	<<if $Mentor == 'Faith'>>
		He helped me in a math class I was struggling in last year.  He's a sweet guy - and really smart too.  Having him right next door would probably be a big help if
		either of us need any tutoring help this year.
	<<else>>
		He's tutored a few of the girls I talked with.  He seems nice.  And smart I guess.

		My ex-girlfriend was into skydiving and Zack is too, so I've met him a few times.  He's a bit on the wild side, but pretty cool.  For a guy anyway.
	<<else>>
		It sounds like he's into rock climbing and skydiving and stuff.  He might be fun to hang out with if you're the adventurous type.

	After you and $Mentor get back from your shopping trip you start unpacking and settling into your room.  Eventually you hear the guys coming in next door.
	<<if $Mentor == "Emily">>
		As soon as Emily hears her boyfriend come in, she excitedly leads you next door to meet him and your other neighbour.
	<<else>>
		Eventually you and $Mentor head over to meet your new neighours.
	<</if>>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
	<<for _i = 0; _i < $neighbours.length; _i++>>
		<br>
		<<switch $neighbours[_i]>>
			<<case "Emily's Boyfriend">>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2F.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br/>
				You try to talk with Emily‘s boyfriend, but she keeps all his attention for herself.  He seems normal though.
				And it gives you more time to get to know your other neighbour.
			<<case 'Barry'>>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2A.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br/>
				On the plus side, you can tell Barry thinks of you the same as he does any other woman.  Though you can quickly tell in his case that might not be such a good
				thing. He doesn't seem to think much of women in general, and of you in particular.  You get the impression he's only interested in one thing from you and the
				other women on campus, and it's not your opinions.
				<br><br>
				"I know a lot of girls like to slut it up their first semester.  Feel free to stop by anytime and I'll give you what you need.  Or at least what you deserve.",
				he tells you.
				<<if $Mentor == "Olivia">>
					"Unless all your best parts are locked away like they are for your roommate that is.", he adds.
					<<if $PlayerChastityBelt>>
						"Ha! I take it from that face you just made you're wearing one too.  Well, I still love blowjobs so the offer still stands.  I'll get my dick sucked, and I
						won't have to hear you talk - that sounds twice as good."
					<</if>>
				<</if>>
			<<case 'James'>>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2B.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br>
				<<if $Mentor == "Hannah">>
					When Hannah sees James she tells you, "Yeah, that is the guy I was thinking off.  He's a fun time if you ever get bored."
					Then she holds her hands an impressive number of inches apart and gives you a thumbs up sign.  James notices the gesture and flashes a smile at you.
					<br><br>
				<</if>>
				As you talk to James he seems quite charming, and says all the right things and you feel like you could just keep talking to him.
				Later, $Mentor warns you,
				<<if $Mentor == "Hannah">>
					"If you're looking for a committment, you'll probably want to look somewhere where else.  But if you are just looking for good time, he'll give you one."
				<<else>>
					"I've seen guys like him before.  He'll charm the pants off a girl like you and quickly move on to the next one."
					<<if $Mentor != "Faith">>
						Of course, if that's what you want too, it'll probably be a good time while it lasts.
					<</if>>
				<</if>>
			<<case 'Peter'>>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2C.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br>
				Peter seems quite shy, especially when he's talking to you.
				<<if $Mentor == "Faith">>
					He seemed more talkative with Faith though.  She tells you later "Don't worry, he'll open up.  Peter's always nervous around girls he's just met,
					especially the pretty ones.  He must really like you."
				<<else>>
					He seems sweet, but you seem to really make him nervous.  He seems a little less nervous talking to $Mentor.  You wonder if it's because he finds you attractive.
				<</if>>
				<br><br>
				Part of you wonders what kind of a boyfriend Peter would make if you could get him to come out of his shell a bit.
			<<case 'Zack'>>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2D.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br>
				<<if $Mentor == "Samantha">>
					"How have you been?", Zack says when he sees Sam walk in.  "I haven't seen you in a while, are you still jumping?"<br><br>
					"No, Beth was the adventerous one, I'm happy keeping both feet on the ground now.", Sam replies before gesturing towards you,
					"I think my roommate here is looking to try new things, so she might be interested."<br><br>
				<</if>>
				As you to talk to Zack you can tell he lives for adventure.  Rock climbing, skydiving, you-name-it, he loves anything that gets the adrenaline going.
				He makes it sounds fun too, he's already talked you into giving skydiving a try - just once to see if you like it.
			<<case 'Josh'>>
				<img src="Part5/Neighbours2E.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400"><br>
				Josh seems like a typical 18 year old guy, a bit immature, but friendly and polite.  If you were still a guy, and he was your roommate, you're guessing
				you would be come good friends.
				<br><br>
				As you get to know him more you find out he’s the first in his family to go to college. He’s excited, and nervous about it all,
				and wants to make the best of it.

	After you are done meeting the guys, you head back to your room to finish unpacking.  You talk with $Mentor for a while before you decide it's time to 
	settle in for your first night's sleep in a new town, a new bed, and a new body.  Hopefully you'll sleep well, tomorrow is another big day, with the

	Pastor Mark has had more time to think about your situation.  "I think you need to act soon.  I can tell your resistance to your desires is starting
	to weaken.  I fear you may decide to give in to them.  And after you did once, I doubt you would hesitate to do so again.  I expect you would sprial
	out of control soon after that. Can you imagine what you might do if that happened?  Sorry, that was a poor choice of words.  Don't actually try to
	imagine that."
<</nobr>>
	
<<nobr>>
	The first thing he wants to try is to give you something else to do to take your mind off of your desires.  "Most of the activities available on
	campus would just put you in more situations that would tempt you to sin.  I'm sure promiscuity and licentious behavior are problems at most campuses,
	but it seems much worse here for some reason."  Faith has told him about how you'd wanted to learn the play the guitar, but had never learned.  He
	offers to teach you, and then you can play at ministry events eventually.  That'll keep you away from temptation as much as possible.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	You can tell him: "That's a wonderful idea.  I need to [[try something|Part5Faith10]]." Or, you could tell him: "Thank you for trying to help me,

<<nobr>>
	You tell them both how horny you are and that you plan on taking one of them back to your room to fuck you. You then tell them you want to make
