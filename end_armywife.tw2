  <h1>Celebrating Justin's Graduation</h1>
  You make the long drive down to the base Justin has been at for Basic Training.  Of course you would have been
  here many times by now if you'd been allowed to visit.  But graduation weekend is the first time he's allowed any
  visitors.

  Justin's parents are there too, and they are all thrilled to meet you.  But other than a few meals together, they don't
  mind that you and Justin want to spend most of his free time alone together.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Unfortunately, you only have the weekend together before he has to ship off to more training, this time to learn the
  skills for his Army job.  He jokes about hiding you and sneaking you off to training with him.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="PartX/Army2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450">
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But unfortunately, it's just a joke.  You can join him at training.  Some better news though is that he'll be allowed
  to leave the base on weekends after a few weeks, so you can come visit him during training.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  And, he's going to see if he can change where his first assignment after that is going to be.  "I never would have
  picked it when I enlisted if I'd known we'd meet.  It seemed like an exciting place to visit when it was just me, but
  being so far away from each other for an entire year would be torture," he tells you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Oh I hope so!" you say excitedly hearing about him maybe getting stationed somewhere closer.  "The
  [[next few weeks|JustinWaiting]] without you, I'm going to miss you so much," you tell him.  "But at
  least it's no as long as Basic was."

  You sometimes have a hard time focusing on your classes, more often your thought turn to how much you miss Justin.
  You do your best to work through it though.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But finally, Justin says that he'll be able to leave the base to [[visit with you on the weekends|JustinTraining]] now.
  You pack some supplies and head off on the long drive to his training base.

  Every weekend you make the long drive to visit Justin. You love being able to see him.  The only thing you worry about
  though is that he still hasn't received an answer on his request to switch his initial duty station.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you aren't together, you talk or text on the phone almost every night.  One of those nights he lets you know he's
  received an answer on his duty station request, but he's not wanting to [[share the answer|JustinTraining2]] with you
  until you are there with him in person.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You beg him to at least tell you now if it's good news or bad news.  "A bit of both," he says cryptically.  You
  are even more anxious than normal as you wait for the weekend to arrive so you can visit again.

  When you first get there, it's like every other time you are together.  You and Justin can't keep your hands off
  each other at first.  But later, after you both can think about other things, you and him discuss the army's
  response to his request.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Well, first the bad news," he says.  "The army rejected my duty station change request.  They evidently need people
  with my MOS at the base I'm heading to.  And of their needs win over our needs."  You are disappointed, but hopeful
  still since he said there was good news too.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "But, some of the other guys told me there's [[a way I could bring you|JustinWedding]] with me when I leave.  But I'm
  not sure if you'll like it or not," he continues.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Anything!" you respond.  "I can't stand the thought of us being apart for an entire year!  Even if I was able to save
  up for a ticket and visit, it'd be torture."

  You and Justin only have two weeks together before he has to ship off to half way around the world for over a year!  You don't
  want to miss a minute of it, so you've told Brian you won't be working for the next two weeks.  With no more school, and no work,
  you can spend every moment with Justin.  And you know exactly how you'll be spending most of it.
<</nobr>>

<video src="PartX/Army4.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="400"></video>

  The two of you spend as much time as you can together, enjoying each other's bodies until you have to stop to eat, or just to
  let your bodies recover.

  <img src="PartX/Army5.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450" align="left">

  You fell asleep after your last round of sex.  You smile a little remembering it as you waking up to the familiar feeling of
  Justin's cum leaking out of you.
  <<if $PlayerProtectionCondoms>>

    The first day back together you'd stopped having Justin even try to pull out before he cums.  It feels too good when his
    cock starts throbbing deep inside you as he cums.  You're pretty sure he enjoys it too.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Justin must have woke back up before you.  You see him sitting down messaging someone on his phone.  When he notices you waking
  up, he smiles at you.  "I've been chatting with some of my Army buddies to see if any of them know of a way I could bring you
  with me," he says.  The smile on his face when he says it, tells you he has an idea that might work.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "They had [[a solution|JustinWedding]].  An obvious one really.  But I'm not sure if you'll like it or not," he continues.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Anything!" you respond.  "I can't stand the thought of us being apart for an entire year! Even if I was able to save

  Justin was right, the solution was obvious once he said it.  If the Army only allows him to bring you with him if you are married,
  then the two of you just need to get married before he leaves!
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I know it's sudden," he says.  "But I'm sure it's something we would have done eventually anyway.  This is just getting us
  to do it sooner

  <</if>>
  You wrap your arms around him and kiss him say, "Yes! That's a wonderful idea!  Of course, I'll marry you!"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He'd already researched the process online, and the two of you get cleaned up and head down to city hall.  An hour or so later,
  you walk out as husband and wife!
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You both have things you need to take care of so that you can join him when he ships out, but you decide that can wait.
  Right now you want to have sex as husband and wife for the first time before you do anything else!

  Justin said the Army said you could join him now that you were married, which was wonderful news.  The only bad news is that
  it will take a few weeks to get all the paperwork taken care of.  So instead of joining him when he leaves, you see him off at
  the airport, and start preparing for your own flight in a few weeks.
  <<if $student>>
    <br><br>
    You are relieved when you get your final grades back.  Though your mind was often elsewhere, you did well enough

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When he starts telling all the things he wants to do to you when you are together again, you decide to give him a show as you

    Normally you feel very little when you touch yourself.  You were planning on just pretending and giving a show for Justin.
    But with him telling you exactly what to do and you following along, it's not triggering the side effect.  The moans you are
    giving are real, not just for Justin's enjoyment.  They'd said your side effect was mental not physical after all.
    <br><br>
    Though an orgasm without Justin there is still out of reach. As he starts to get close, your cry out, begging for him to cum
    inside you.  As he cums for real, you pretend like you do as well to enhance his enjoyment.  But instead you feel the aching
    need to feel Justin inside you return.

    You moan as you slide your fingers into yourself, thrusting them faster or slower as Justin tells you exactly how he plans to
    fuck you when you are together again.  It feels so good, though still nowhere near as good as the real thing.  Though Justin's
    own moans as he follows along with his hand on his cock turn you own even more.

      to look back up at your screen, you see Justin smiling back at you.  After his orgasm was over, he's been enjoying watching
      yours.
      <br><br>
      You pull your fingers out of you, imagining it's Justin's cock.  But you don't feel the trail of his cum leaking down to your ass
      like you normally do when he pulls out of you.  You miss that feeling.  Well, you miss everything about being with Justin,

  of course, it has its own bathroom.  You won't need to head to the women's floor every time you need to use one anymore.

  taking turns to wake up and change the baby in the middle of the night, for example.  But it's always you that has to wake up
  when it's time to feed the <<print $children[0].name>>.
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  By the third week you aren't as tired or sore anymore, only just sleep-deprived.  And you are really starting to feel horny again.
  You hate that you have to wait another whole month before Justin can fuck you again.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral > 2 >>
    But there's nothing you love more than sucking Justin's cock.  And he's more than happy to let you.
  <<elseif $PlayerSideEffectOral>>
    But you love sucking Justin's cock, and he's more than happy to let you.
  <<else>>
    But you don't want to make Justin wait too.  He asks if that's fair to you, but you make it clear you want it as much as he does.
    You only wish you could have more.
  <</if>>
  Hearing him moan as you suck his cock gets you so wet.  You ache for him to fuck you until he cums inside you.  But
  hearing him groan and feeling your mouth fill with his cum is wonderful too.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral == 1>>
    <br><br>
    <i>You realize you love sucking Justin's cock even more than you did before.</i>
    <<set $PlayerSideEffectOral += 1>>
  <<elseif !$PlayerSideEffectOral>>
    <br><br>
    <i>You realize you really love sucking Justin's cock.</i>
    <<set $PlayerSideEffectOral to 2>>
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You and Justin have talked, and you want to wait a while before having another child.
  <<if $PlayerProtectionFertile>>
    <<set $PlayerProtectionMalePill to 1>>
    <<unset $PlayerProtectionNone>>
    Since you can't take birth control, Justin starts taking the new male birth control pill.  Thankfully it's approved by the Army,
    and free too.
  <<else>>
    So you start taking birth control
    <<set $PlayerProtectionPill to 1>>
    <<unset $PlayerProtectionNone>>
    <<if $PlayerProtectionPillFormer>>
      pills again.
    <<else>>
      pills.
    <</if>>
  <</if>>
  They should be in full effect by the time you're allowed to have sex again.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When the six weeks are finally up, Justin can't help but tease you, making you whimper as he slides his cock against your lips
  but doesn't enter.  Thankfully, the pleading look in your eyes is enough to make him stop teasing and start fucking you.
  It feels so amazing after six weeks you are worried your moans are going to wake the baby.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You finally start to get into a routine, with taking care of the house, the baby, and spending time with Justin.  But before
  you know it, it's time to start packing and getting ready for the move [[to a new base|ArmyWife3]]
<</nobr>>

::ArmyWife3 <2600,15500>
<<nobr>>
  <h1>Family visiting at your new base</h1>
  Thankfully, the short assignment was just for Justin's first base.  The Army told Justin he could expect to be at this new base
  for at least two, maybe three years.  And even better, this base isn't overseas.
  <<set setup.addSexRepeat(500, {sex:"male", name:"Justin"})>>
  <<set setup.addSexRepeat(500, {sex:"male", name:"Justin", vaginal:true})>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It's still several states away, but at least know your family can come visit and meet Justin and $children[0].name for the first time.
  <<if $FatherDisown>>
    You are even able to patch things up with your dad.  He said he was only worried about you going down 'the wrong path', and he's
    thrilled that you've settled down and started a family.
    And he looks so happy holding his new <<if $children[0].sex == "male">>grandson<<else>>granddaughter<</if>>
    that you can't help but forgive him for your early disagreements.
  <<else>>
    They are also so happy to meet them both, and to see you again.  Your father comments on how happy he is that you've settled down
    and started a family.  He said he was worried you might go down 'the wrong path'.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <div style="float:left;padding:12px;">
    <video src="Part14/Home60.webm" autoplay loop muted height="400"></video>
  </div>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You have a fairly good idea what 'wrong path' your father is thinking you were on.
  <br><br>
  You keep to yourselves exactly how the two of you met, so you don't confirm what you know your father was already thinking
  about you.
  <br><br>
  Instead, you've only told them that "We met at the coffee shop where I used to work."  It's not a lie, but it also
  doesn't include the part with your sucking Justin's cock in his car either.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The two of you weren't planning on bringing it up, but your father asks Justin what he plans on doing when his enlistment
  is up.  So you and Justin let them know that he plans on reenlisting, and making a career out of it.  Your father seems very happy
  with this news.  Your mother seems to just be hoping your next base is closer so she can visit more.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When your mother asks if $children[0].name is going to be an only child, or if you plan on more, you let her know what you
  and Justin are planning.  "We are thinking of having another baby in a few years, once [[Justin is a Sergeant|ArmyWife4]]."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Eventually the visit is over, and your family has to head back to the airport.  Justin starts to help you tidy up from their
  visit, but you take his hand and lead him back to the bedroom instead.  "I'll deal with that while you are at work.  The baby is
  sleeping, and I don't want to miss our opportunity."
<</nobr>>

::ArmyWife4 <2800,15500>
<<nobr>>
  <h1>Promoted</h1>
  <img src="PartX/Army14.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="350" align="left">
  <<set $tempBabyName to [$tempBabyNameBoys, $tempBabyNameGirls]>>
  <<set $tempBaby to $tempBabyName[either(0,1)].shift()>>
  <<set $children.push($tempBaby)>>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  Part way through his second enlistment, Justin finally gets the promotion to Sergeant you'd both been wait for.
  <<if $PlayerProtectionMalePill>>He is<<else>>You are<</if>> only off the pill for a few weeks before you are pregnant again.
  "One of the many benefits of being young, healthy, and having sex all the time," he jokes.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The new base is closer to your home town, so when $children[1].name is born, your mom is able to come by and stay for a few
  weeks to help out. Thankfully there's enough room for everyone with the house the Army assigned for Justin.  $children[0].name
  is thrilled
  <<if $children[0].sex == "male">>
    he will still have his
  <<else>>
    she will still have her
  <</if>>
  own room.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You and Justin plan on stopping at just two kids, so <<if $PlayerProtectionMalePill>>he<<else>>you<</if>> got back on the pill
  as soon as $children[1].name is born.  By the time the maddening six weeks are up again, you are eager to feel Justin inside you
  again.  It's all you can do to wait until $children[0].name and $children[1].name are sound asleep.  Trying to stay quiet so
  you don't wake them both up is even harder.
<</nobr>>

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You know you are going to have your hands full now with preschooler and a baby in the house, with trying to find time for
  you and Justin to be intimate.  But you wouldn't want it any other way.  And hopefully, Justin will be at this base for a
  while, you really like the school $children[0].name will be starting at next year.
