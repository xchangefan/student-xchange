  You've gotten used to filling out these forms now.  You no longer feel weird filling in all the questions talking about your
  periods, number of sex partners, birth control, and all the other personal details they ask about.

      dosage or whatever.

    You don't really remember exactly when your last period was.  You've been so busy lately you haven't really kept track so you just put a
    question mark there and move on to the birth control question.

      You write down 'N/A'.  There's obviously no chance you are pregnant.

      Obviously you aren't using any. Hopefully the pregnancy test will be positive today.

      hot actor you have a crush on, and it was just a dream. You did wake up wet and dripping down there, but that wasn't
      from him, but from your body's reaction to your dream.  You try to focus, and just write

  As you consider your options, and the father, your mind can't help but imagine what your body will look like a few months from now.

  You already know there's one option you won't consider, an abortion.  That's fine for some women, but not something you'd consider.
  Part of you wonders even if God wanted you to become pregnant, making sure you got pregnant even when you weren't having sex that
  should have resulted in a baby.

  You know people probably won't believe you that you haven't ever had proper sex, and you don't really see the point in abstaining
  anymore, at least with your baby's father.  Your 'virgin' vagina is going to have a baby passing through it in eight, or however
  many, months anyway.  The only one you'll be honest with about it is the baby's father.

<<nobr>>
  <<if setup.hadAnalAccident("Barry") and setup.hadAnalAccident("Andrew")>>
    Except you aren't sure who that is.  Obviously it can only be Barry or Andrew, but you remember a messy time or two with both of

    You decide you'll need to get a sample for them to test so you can know and be sure.  Of course, you can't just ask for one,

    After they cum on your face, you head to the bathroom to 'clean up'.  While you are there, you take the cum from your face and

	When you first start to tell Barry, he doesn't believe you.  "We've never even actually fucked!" he says.  You tell him about the time
  his cum leaked and when you must have gotten pregnant.  He's still very skeptical, but now he's surprised and annoyed that you didn't just
  "deal with it" as soon as you found out about the pregnancy.  But when he gets past that, he's back to doubting that he is the actual
  father.  He demands a paternity test - with him providing a cheek swab directly to the lab himself.
  <<if setup.hadAnalAccident("Andrew")>>
    He doesn't trust the one you obtained, "You could have labeled any guy's cum with my name.  I'll go in myself," he tells you.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When the test comes back positive, he accepts that he is the father, though he's clearly not happy about it.  "You can't fault me
  for wanting to be sure.  I still thank it's crazy you got pregnant when I was just fucking your ass!"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I hope you don't think I'm going to help you raise that thing, I'm certainly not interested in being a father yet.  You know if you
  are having second thoughts about it, it's not too late to go back and have them get rid of it for you.  If you are concerned about
  the cost of that, I'd be more than happy to pay it. Actually, how about I just give you
  [[a couple thousand dollars I have saved up|Part16PregnantLoopholeBarryAbortionBribe]], and that should cover it, right?  You can
  keep whatever extra is left."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I know it's your decision though.  If you decide to keep it, don't expect me to be driving you to doctor's
  appointments and shit.  If you plan on putting it up for adoption, then that's probably a good idea, you aren't ready to be a
  mother yet, let me know if there's anything I need to sign to help with that."

  "Though if you decide to keep it, I know I'll be stuck paying child support for the next 18 years.  I won't be able to afford
  much."

  The more you think about it the more Barry's idea sounds like a good one.  You aren't ready to be a mother.  Especially a single
  mother with no help from the father.  And it's going to be so humiliating being pregnant, because no one is going to believe you
  weren't slutting around to get this way.  And you feel bad "trapping" Barry when he didn't even have real sex with you.

      "Of course, we both know that it's possible that it's someone else's.  But you let me fuck other men, sometimes right in front of you, and you loved every
      minute of it," you tell him.
      <br><br>
      "I'm going to need help these next few months.  And the baby is going to need a father.  And you'd do a much better job than any of the other
      possibilities"
      <br><br>
      "Unless you don't agree.  If you aren't sure you deserve this reward, if you'd rather get us tested to be sure, just say so and I'll stop..."
      <br><br>
      "We don't need to do that.  It's definitely my baby. I'm the baby's father!", Peter pleads.
      <br><br>
      "Wonderful.  After tonight, on all the forms, and if anyone asks, you're the father - it couldn't be anyone else.  I know you're going to make an excellent
      father," you tell him before your lips return to his cock.

      "I'm going to need help these next few months.  And the baby is going to need a father.  And I know you're going to make an excellent father," you tell him
      before your lips return to his cock.
    <</if>>
  <<else>>
    "Of course, we both know your cock was safely locked away when it happened, but I still couldn't have done it with out you.  If you hadn't let me fuck other men,
    sometimes right in front of you even, then this never would have been possible."
    <br><br>
    "But I'm going to need help these next few months.  And the baby is going to need a father.  And you'd do a much better job than... whoever it was."
    <br><br>
    "Unless you don't agree.  If you don't think you deserve this reward, just say so and I'll stop..."

    "It's my baby. I'm the baby's father!", Peter pleads.

  You keep it slow, trying to make his reward last as long as possible.  You've gotten good at knowing when he's getting close.  Most nights you'd stop now and
  leave him frustrated, but not tonight.  You keep going until he groans and and cums in your mouth.  He's still cumming as your lips slide back off his cock.

  You don't bother to wipe your face and move up to give him a long, passionate kiss.  When you've finished you reach over for his chastity cage.  "Let's lock
  this beast back up.  He doesn't really have a job to do for the next nine months, does he," you smile then add, "But I might let him out to play before then."

<<nobr>>
  Once Peter's cock is caged and you've uncuffed his hands, the two of you can sit down to go over your plans for the summer. TODO Link (and not summer)

  You aren't sure how he's going to react.
  <<if setup.sexVaginalCount() == 0>>
    Obviously neither of you were expecting a pregnancy since you'd never had sex other than anal and oral.
    <<if $PlayerChastityBelt>>
      You wonder if he'd suspect you cheated on him, and did something more with someone else, if you weren't wearing this belt.
    <<else>>
      You wonder if he suspects you cheated on him, and did something more with someone else.  If he does, he doesn't say anything,
      or do anything else to indicate any doubts that the baby is his.
    <</if>>
  <<elseif setup.sexUniqueVaginalCount() == 1>>
    He knows that he's the only man you've ever been with, so there's no question that he's the father.
  <<else>>
    He knows that he's not the first man you've been with, but he doesn't question that he's the father.
  <</if>>
  In fact, he's thrilled at the news he's going to be a father.
  "I'd always wanted a child. This is sooner than I had originally planned, but it's still wonderful news!" he tells you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You surprised him today with this news.  But he [[surprises you|JaydenPropose]] a few days later, with something else that you both
  had considered some day but may be happening much sooner now also.
