  <</if>>
  You'd thought you still had a long way to go before you'd be off probation, so you were thrilled when you received a notice
  from the X-Change office about the removal of your denial effect that the dean's office had scheduled for you.  You received the
  email about the appointment with the dean a bit later.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are less excited about the meeting with the dean, but since the X-Change people said his final approval is needed before they'll
  actually deactivate the effect for you, you don't plan on being late for that meeting either.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You look through your wardrobe to find something nice to wear.  You plan on having some fun as soon as you leave the X-Change office
  and can orgasm again. When you actually get your meeting with the dean, it quickly moves in a different direction than you were expecting.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "$playerName, I had hoped we wouldn't need to have this meeting," the dean tells you.  "Like I'd mentioned when we met last year,
  we recognize that students sometimes struggle their first semester.  That's why we have academic probation, to give students a second
  chance." 
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Out of consideration for your participation in the X-Change trial, we even gave you a third chance when you continued to struggle
  second semester," he continues.  "However, to let you continue any longer wouldn't be fair to you, to your fellow students, to your
  professors, or to other potential students who could better utilize a place at our university."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "But... but... I've been 
  <<if $AcademicProbationTutor == "alone">>
  <<elseif $AcademicProbationTutor>>
    working really hard with my tutors and 
  <<else>>
    seeing a tutor and
  <</if>>
  trying to get caught back up," you try to explain.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I'm not saying you haven't tried to improve, $playerName," he says. "But perhaps this university is just too challenging for you.  Or
  maybe your... other interests... have been too much of a distraction.  Whatever the reason, you haven't made the required progress
  in your classes from last year, and two of your professors say there's little to no chance of you passing their courses this semester.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "For the three classes you are doing adequately in, your professors said they'd waive the final for you and give you a 'Pass' grade
  for the term.  Your professors from the courses you failed last year have also generously agreed to retroactively change your grades
  to 'Pass' as well, based on what progress you have made since then.  That will give you a few additional credits if you decide to
  transfer to a community college.  The professors for the two classes you are going to fail have agreed to let you withdraw late and not
  receive a grade, so there won't be any "F" grades on your transcript.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "That is contingent on you [[signing this form|OffProbationContract]], which states that you are withdrawing from the university
  voluntarily, and that your academic troubles are in no way related to your participating in the X-Change trial."  He then hands you a
  document that says essentially that.  "Of course, withdrawing from the university is also a prerequisite for removing the academic
  probation denial on your implant."
<</nobr>>

::OffProbationContract <200,13400>
<<nobr>>
  <h1>Voluntary Withdrawal Agreement</h1>

  <<unset $SchoolWeek>>
  <<unset $student>>
  <<set $Dropout to "Flunk">>
  You look over the agreement he's given you to sign, and it essentially says what the dean said it did, though it acts like it is all
  your idea.  It states that you are withdrawing from the university of your own free will, and that your participation in the X-Change
  trial is unrelated to your withdrawal.  It mentions the "Pass" grades you will be receiving and that the university will be
  waiving the drop deadline for the other two classes.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $Major == "Criminal Justice">>
    <<set $DropoutContactNegotiate to 1>>
    You know enough about the law, from the classes you have been doing well in, to know that there's room to negotiate here.
    Clearly they are wanting to protect the X-Change trial.  If girls in the program start blaming the academic problems on the
    X-Change trial, then it could look bad on the implant.  But if you decide to leave on your own, then it's not a problem for them.
  <<elseif $Major == "Business">>
    <<set $DropoutContactNegotiate to 1>>
    You know enough about contracts from the classes you have been doing well in, to know that you probably shouldn't take
    the first offer.  This is a negotiation.  They clearly want to keep the X-Change trial from looking bad.  So it's just a matter
    of figuring out how far they are willing to go to protect their study statistics from whatever you flunking out would do to them.
  <<elseif $JamesBribe>>
    <<set $DropoutContactNegotiate to 1>>
    You know about dealing with lawyers and contracts from the business with James and the pregnancy.  The university is  clearly willing
    to offer you more than normal to withdrawal and protect the X-Change trial from looking bad.  Now it's just a matter of seeing
    how much you can get out of that.
  <<elseif $BrokenLeg or $FormerBrokenLeg>>
    <<set $DropoutContactNegotiate to 1>>
    You know about dealing with lawyers and contracts from dealing with the insurance companies over your leg.  The university is clearly
    willing to offer you more than normal to withdrawal and protect the X-Change trial from looking bad.  Now it's just a matter of
    seeing how much you can get out of that.
  <<else>>
    It seems generous that they are letting you get grades for the classes you are doing well in, and not making you have Fs for
    the ones you failed, or are about to fail.  You wonder why they are being so nice, but you aren't going to complain - especially
    since it means you could be orgasming an hour from now.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $DropoutContactNegotiate>>
    "The academic portion of the agreement sounds adequate," you say trying to sound professional.  "However, I don't see anything
    about financial compensation."  You then mention the money you've paid for books and other school expenses not covered by your
    scholarship.  You mention how you'll likely have moving expenses, and other unexpected living expenses when you leave the
    university.
    <br><br>
    Of course, the dean doesn't know or care if those are really what you are needing money for.  He knows you understand their
    position and are trying make the best of it.  And he clearly was expecting it as he pulls out an envelope with cash.  "This
    should help you with the transition period," he tells you.  "We don't need to add it to the written agreement, but it's yours
    if you sign."
    <br><br>
    You glance at the money, and at the dean.  You doubt you can get much more from him, so you go ahead and sign the agreement.
    As soon as you do he pushes the envelope of cash over to you.  You quickly pick it up and put it away.
  <<else>>
    You go ahead and sign the contract and hand it over to the dean.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Thank you, $playerName.  It's unfortunate that things didn't work out better for you here.  I'll send a message over to
  the X-Change office giving them final approval to turn off that setting on your implant," the dean tells you.
  You quickly [[head over to the X-Change office|OffProbationXChange]] so they can do just that.

  You head over to the X-Change office as soon as you leave the dean's office.  Now that you aren't a student here anymore, you aren't on
  academic hold any longer and they'll take the denial setting off of your belt.  You are already fantasizing about what you'll
  do when you leave their office.

  You were hoping the technician would repeat the 'test' he performed when he'd disabled your ability to cum, but he says it's not

  He checks a few things more on your settings and tells you

    "It looks like your repeated orgasm attempts while you were on the denial setting have triggered a side effect."  You
    start to try to deny doing that, but then give up and keep listening.  "Oh, that's good, he says relieved.  It looks like you'll

    He checks over the screen then informs you, "As you know, your implant, and the denial effect you were on are experimental.
    It seems that something triggered unexpectedly.  It is now permanent."  He sees the look of shock and horror on your face
    as you contemplate the denial effects you've been suffering the past months being permanent.  He quickly clarifies, "Your

    After the initial scare,

      "Well, perhaps you stumbled on the treatment on your own just having fun," he says.

    is related to the "Breeder" option that some of our pills have, and that has developed on a few of the implants - not yours though."

    "The girls that have been trying to get pregnant have had the least problems with the "Orgasm Block" effect.  Those not actively trying
    to get pregnant, but also not using any form of birth control also have had fewer problems.  Our lesbian users have had the most issues.

  Marcus even takes you to the discount store to buy some more maternity clothes.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You feel so great after a shower, you don't even mind when Marcus comes over to you after your shower, and tugs at the towel
  that was doing its best to try to cover you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I want to see if you look as pretty all cleaned up as I thought you would."  You let go of the towel and let him pull
  it away.  You are embarrassed, but start smiling when he starts telling you how beautiful you are. 
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I'll start looking for work again tomorrow, so I can pay you back for all of this," you tell him.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Don't worry about that.  Just take it easy until you have the baby.  You can pay me back after.  I'll have work for you then,"
  Marcus replies.  You thank him again for being so generous.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He places his hand under you chin and gently pushes up so you are looking him in the eye.  "Though, judging from how you are
  blushing all over, I think you're thinking of [[another way you could show me your gratitude|FlunkOutPregnant4]]."

  Marcus was right, being naked in front of him, and seeing the outline of his hard cock through his pants, that was
  exactly what you were thinking about.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You drop to your knees and unzip his pants.  As soon as his cock springs out, you take it into your mouth.  After a
  while he helps you stand back up and lie down on the bed.  His fingers tease your clit, your lips, and finally slide into you.
  Before long and you can hear your wetness as his fingers slide back and forth.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He pulls his fingers out and has you suck them.  Then he rubs his hard cock between your lips until he finally thrusts into you.
  It isn't long until you are screaming out with an orgasm.  Marcus keeps fucking you for a good while longer.  You are orgasming
  a second time when he thrusts one last time and cums inside you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He doesn't have to ask. As soon as he puts his cock near your face, you move toward it and take it into your mouth, cleaning
  the shine from your juices from it, as well as a few drops of cum.  "Oh, they're going to love you," he says to himself.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "What?" you ask in a post-orgasm haze.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He gives your ass a gentle swat and says, "Don't worry about it baby.  Just get a good nights sleep.   I have to go back to
  work.  I'll be by tomorrow and take you out for a late breakfast.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He does come by [[the next morning|FlunkOutPregnant5]].  After breakfast he takes you to the little corner grocery store
  down the block and buys you some groceries to put in the little refrigerator in your room.  Of course after that the two
  of you head back to your room for sex again.

  Marcus doesn't come by every day, you know he spends time with his 'other girls'.  You don't know how many other
  girls he is seeing besides you.  But he's says you are his 'special girl'.  You wonder if that means he might want
  to settle down exclusively with you eventually.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He's not there every day, but he does come by whenever you need him.  He's taken you to all your doctor's appointments.
  He's even helped arrange a private adoption with some rich couple.  You're happy to know your baby is going to have
  a much better life than you could offer him or her.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He even takes you shopping for groceries when you need them.  At first you wondered why he just didn't give you a little
  cash and you could do it.  But then you though, maybe he's worried you by drugs or something with it and hurt the baby.
  Maybe he'll realize you aren't like that eventually.  But it's fine for now, besides, the help carrying things is great too.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He's still careful because of the baby, but Marcus is more forceful when you are having sex than he was that first night.
  You can tell he loves holding your head on his cock while you are sucking it, forcing it deeper.  And he loves spanking
  your ass when he fucks you from behind.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't want one of those other girls taking your place as his 'special girl', so you are eager to please him.  Though
  it helps they you get wet every time he puts his hands around your throat or you struggle to breath with his cock in your throat.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He didn't want you being without a phone while you were pregnant, so he got you one of those cheap disposable ones for
  emergencies.  It's a good thing too, because you need it to call him when you feel
  [[your contractions starting|FlunkOutPregnant6]]!

  Marcus takes you to the hospital, and is with you at first.  But once they have you with a room he leaves you in
  the care of the doctors and nurses.  He then leaves to go contact the couple that are going to adopt the baby.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  At first your labor is uncomfortable, but not unbearable.  The nurses have you walking up and down the hallway to help
  the process along.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But soon the contractions are getting closer together and more painful and they have you return to your room.  After a few
  more hours your water breaks.  You toss your drenched gown, not carrying if the nurses or doctor see you naked.  It's not
  like they aren't seeing a lot more every time they come in to check on you anyway.

  As the contractions get stronger and even more frequent, you really wish the free insurance Marcus helped you sign up for
  would pay for an epidural, but it won't, so you just have to endure.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But eventually it's over.  You try not to look at the baby, but are happy to hear them say it looks healthy before

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  They keep you overnight at the hospital.  But the insurance company says since you are healthy and didn't have any anesthesia,

  you again and takes you to lunch.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you get back to your room, you can tell he wants sex.  Normally you would too.  But even if the doctor hadn't said
  anything, everything still hurts and you can't imagine how bad sex would feel right now.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I'm sorry, I can't have sex right now.  The doctor said not for six weeks," you tell Marcus.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "They always say that," he says.  "But two weeks is usually enough for you X-Change girls.  You heal so fast, at least from
  childbirth."  You are happy to hear that, but it still doesn't help today.  Then he adds, "But your mouth is perfectly healthy
  right now."  He then gently but firmly pushes you down toward you knees.  You unzip his pants and get to work.

  As you swallow down his cum he tells you, "That's my special girl."  You can't help but smile.  You get even more excited

  You aren't sure what you were expecting your 'special surprise' to be, but you certainly weren't expecting Marcus to bring
  another guy with him.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Jesse here didn't believe me when I told him how good you suck cock.  Why don't you show him," Marcus tells you.  He can
  probably sense your hesitation and adds, "you don't want to disappoint me do you? Or Jesse for that matter?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He's right, you'd hate to disappoint him.  Though something in the firmness of the way he said it also makes you a little
  scared of disappointing him too.  But you tell yourself it should be fun making them both happy, and proving to Jesse the
  Marcus was right about how good you are.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="PartX/Flunk15.gif" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400">
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  After a while taking turns with both of them, Marcus tells you to focus on Jesse's cock.  You get to work giving Jesse's
  cock the same attention you always give Marcus's.  Jesse clearly loves it, and soon you feel his cock start to twitch and
  then feel his warm cum fill your mouth.  A little bit later you feel Marcus's cum cover your chest as he finishes himself
  onto you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "You're right.  She's great.  Worth every penny," Jesse says as he hands some cash over to Marcus.  You figure they must have bet
  on whether you were as good as Marcus said you were.  You are glad you didn't disappoint.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  After Jesse leaves Marcus tells you how happy he is with you.  "And see, I told you I'd have work for you once you were done
  with the baby."  He puts the cash in his pocket and says, "I'll consider this your first payment towards paying me back what
  you owe me."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Make sure you're home [[tomorrow evening|Whore]]," Marcus tells you before leaving.  "I'll be by sometime to see you."

  At six a clock you hear a knock on your door.  You are surprised when you open it and it's not Marcus.  But when he tells you
  that Marcus sent him you are less worried.  You don't say anything as he walks in to your room.  You see him put an envelope down
  on your dresser as you are closing your door.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Take your clothes off," he tells you.  "Let's see what I'm paying for."  When you start to say something he adds,
  "Let's see what you've got under all that.  Don't worry, Marcus already told me your pussy is on the disabled list still."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You do as he tells you and strip.  He turns you around a few times before pushing you down towards you knees in front of him.
  You know what to do and being to unzip his pants and start sucking his cock.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You expect him to leave after he cums in your mouth.  But instead he pulls out more money and sets it next to the envelope.
  He said that was enough if I wanted to try your ass too.  It's too cute to pass up.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't know what would have happened to you if Marcus hadn't helped you.  And you know if you upset him now, you might
  be homeless again.  Or something worse could happen.  You don't want to find out.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectAnal > 1>>
    Besides, you can never turn down anal sex, so you'd eagerly accept anyway.

  It hurts at first, but you think it's probably just because you are tensing up, afraid he's going to 'accidentally' miss
  your ass.  But once it's clear he's not going to miss, and he gets going, you are moaning as much as he is.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Several more 'friends' of Marcus stop by, each leaving cash and making use of your mouth or ass, before

  really skilled at making men feel good."  He keeps playing with your lips, or stroking your clit as he talks, "You
  might as well keep a roof over your head instead of doing it for free.  Isn't that right?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are close to an orgasm, and eager for him to keep going, "Yes, sir." you say nodding.  The pleading tone of your
  voice begging him not to stop what he's doing.

  He doesn't stop, and soon you are covering his fingers as you orgasm.  "See, good girls get rewarded.  Hopefully you'll never
  have to worry about what bad girls get," he tells you.

  "It seems like you are almost healed up down there.  You should be good to go [[next weekend|Whore3]].  Get a good
  nights rest and I'll be by for lunch tomorrow.  Then we'll go buy some new outfits for you with some of this,"

    let him make sure he never does it again to anyone else.
    <br><br>

  And Marcus said you don't need to worry about the cops either.  "They look the other way in this neighborhood.  They worst
  they'll do is ask me for a little piece of the action.  Or you for a little piece of something else.  Either way, we just
  give them what they want and everyone is happy."

  he tells you.  "Maybe if you weren't always trying to slut it up and thinking about fucking every guy on campus, then you would
  have actually passed a class or two.

    Maybe you can have the abortion clinic provide tutors.  With as much time as you've probably spent there, it might have helped.
