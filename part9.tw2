  still discovering your sexuality and what you want in a relationship.
  <br><br>
  And you are a bit surprised when he doesn't even argue about it when you tell him that he won't be getting his key back
  unless he starts dating someone.  It's like he knows his cock shouldn't be free and that he shouldn't be able to decide
  his own orgasms, and he's right.

  He's excited when he thinks you and Veronica are going to keep the key, but he gets even more excited when he finds out
  what you actually plan on doing with his key.

  Of course you and Veronica will still have access to his key, but so will all of your other sorority sisters too.
  They were talking about how everyone always needs tutoring, and you figured Peter would be perfect for that.  He
  completely agrees.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You knew he'd be more than willing to make time for them known that any one of them can make use of his key if they
  want to unwind after studying.  Though, he quickly learns that they don't always need his key for that.  Sometimes they
  want to be sure he doesn't get them pregnant, or they are worried about him cumming too soon after not being unlocked 
  for a while.  Others want to save unlocking him as a reward for after their grade on whatever he helped them with comes
  back.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You and Veronica still get his help studying from time to time, but you don't ever unlock him.  You don't want him
  to get the wrong idea and feel like you and him are dating again.  If he asks nice though after helping you and her,
  you let him watch the two of you make out.  With his cage still on, of course.

	You tell Peter that you don't want him to be dishonest on his review.  You'd hate to get into the Deltas on a lie.  He can
	tell them just exactly how much you tease and deny him, and how much he loves every minute of it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	You give him a lesson on honesty this evening.  Normally this toy is just for you, but tonight Peter gets to enjoy it too.
	But he has to be honest with you.  He has to tell you whenever he gets close to an orgasm, even though he knows you'll stop when
	he tells you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	He hopes that one of the times you won't stop.  That one of these times he'll tell you he's about to cum, and you won't
	immediately pull it away, you'll hold it there and make him cum and hold it there afterwards until he can't stand it.

	Peter wrote your review for you, and it was everything you'd hoped for.  The Delta's were impressed with his devotion to you.  They
	joke about how blue Peter's balls must be by now.  "But Smurfette here likes their balls blue," one of them says.  You quickly realize
	that your new nickname at your sorority is going to be Smurfette.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	They tell you that since you just have the one review, and Peter's not in their brother fraternity, they'll need a litle bit more from
	you.  But they tell you not to worry, you'll leave the [[frat boys with balls as blue as Peters|Part9DTFBoyfriend3]].
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
	That's tomorrow though, tonight you are going to reward Peter.  As you slide along his cock, he keeps hoping you'll let him inside you
	tonight.  You were thinking about it, but before you can, his long-deprived cock decides it can't wait any longer.  His cum sprays up
	hitting your clit and then dripping down onto his stomach.  You use it as extra lubrication as you keep sliding across his cock a
	while longer.
