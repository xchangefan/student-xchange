  If he had ordered you to go back to school, you would have.  If he had ordered you to stay, you would have done that too.  But Mike wanted you to make this decision
  on your own.  Of course you decided to drop out of school and stay here with your Master, Mike.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You know once you move in, your relationship with him won't be a secret to anyone anymore.  There are going to be some people that judge you both because Mike used
  to be your uncle, but you don't care.  You aren't related anymore, so you think they should just mind their own business.

    so much more with Mike.

  Mike uses your body however he wants, of course.  You'd be disappointed if
  he didn't.  But afterwards he holds you, and strokes your hair, and tells you what a good girl you were.  You aways know how much he cares for you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He's thrilled you are moving in.  He throws a back yard party to celebrate with some of his closest friends.  Your father isn't there, so he
  has you wear what you normally do, not much at all.  His friends don't mind in the least.
<</nobr>>

  <h1>Your Father Vists with Mike</h1>
  <img src="PartX/Uncle2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="550" align="left">
  You know your father is coming to visit Mike and you today, and you are nervous about what you are going to say.  You soon discover that you don't have to
  worry about that, since you won't be saying anything.  It's just going to be the two of them talking.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are still worried what your father is going to say though, since this is the first time you've spent any time with him since you moved in with Mike.  Well,
  and you obviously are wondering how your father is going to react to the gag Mike has ordered you to wear.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Your father doesn't have anything to say to you beyond a few greetings.  Him and Mike however talk to each other as if you aren't there.  "... I knew he was never
  going to end up as a man," your father tells Mike.  "At times, I'd worried he'd end up walking the street trying to earn money for a Plus pill.  I'd been
  considering just buying one for him to avoid that.  But thankfully, that university program happened and made that all unnecessary."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I had hoped the university would help train her to be a proper young woman," your father continues.  "But they just turned her loose and let her run wild.
  Having a strong hand to guide her is the best she could have hoped for then.  And I'm glad it's someone I know and trust like you."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "If things had worked out between you and Kim, then you and I would be still be brothers-in-law.  I hope you don't mind, I still think of you as a brother,"
  your dad tells Mike.  "I don't think that's going to change if some day you end up being my son-in-law."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You gasp a bit at your dad's comment, but no one hears it thanks to your gag.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  That went far better than you'd imagined, you think as your father leaves.  Once your father is gone, Mike removes your gag and cuffs, and reminds you
  that you need to get ready [[for your appointment|UncleSub3]]

  <<if $tempCelebrate == 'orgasm'>>
    Your heart races as the vibrations start and you can feel every bit of it.  You use what little movement you can make to grind into the head of the vibrator

  You look up at Mike and see a smile on his face.  You wonder how many orgasms he's going to force from you before he's decided you've had enough?

  Many orgasms later, long after you thought you couldn't take any more, Mike decides you've had enough.  You can barely stand when he unfastes your cuffs from the

  As he straightens up some things in the basement and sets up equipment for whatever fun he has planned for you next he glances over admiring you. "Actually you

  where everyone can see you the next time we have guests over."
